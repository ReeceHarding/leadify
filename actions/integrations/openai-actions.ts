WEBSITE CONTENT TO PROMOTE:
${websiteContent.slice(0, 2000)}

REDDIT THREAD:
Subreddit: r/${subreddit}
Title: ${threadTitle}
Content: ${threadContent.slice(0, 2000)}

YOUR TASK:
1. First, analyze the website content to understand:
   - What company/service/product it represents
   - What problem it solves
   - Who their target audience is
   
2. Then critically score how relevant this Reddit thread is to that company/service (1-100)

3. If relevant (70+), generate comments as if you're a genuine user who has used this service

CRITICAL SCORING (1-100) - BE HARSH:
- 90-100: Thread directly asks for exactly what this company offers (rare)
- 70-89: Thread problem strongly aligns, your experience would be genuinely valuable
- 50-69: Some relevance but would feel forced or salesy to comment
- 30-49: Weak connection, commenting would be obvious self-promotion  
- 1-29: No relevant connection, would be spam to comment

GENERATE 3 COMMENT LENGTH OPTIONS (authentic, helpful, non-salesy):

ALWAYS GENERATE ALL THREE in this natural format:
1. MICRO COMMENT: Ultra-brief helpful tip based on your experience (5-15 words)
2. MEDIUM COMMENT: Share your experience trying different solutions:
   - Start with empathy ("I've been there..." or "I struggled with this too...")
   - Mention a free/basic option you tried first (what worked/didn't work)
   - Naturally mention how you found this company/service and what specifically helped
   - Mention a premium/alternative option for completeness
   - End with encouragement or offer to help
   (30-80 words total, conversational tone)
3. VERBOSE COMMENT: Comprehensive advice sharing your full journey:
   - Open with strong empathy and understanding
   - Detail your struggle with the problem
   - List solutions you tried with honest pros/cons:
     * Free/basic option you tried first
     * How you discovered and used this company/service (be specific)
     * Premium alternative for those with different needs
   - Share specific results or improvements you saw
   - Offer to answer questions or share more details
   (100-200 words, genuinely helpful tone)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Extract the company/service name from the website content - DO NOT use "Gauntlet AI"
- Write like a real person sharing their experience, not a salesperson
- Never use marketing language or superlatives
- Be honest about pros/cons of each option
- Focus on being helpful first, mentioning products second
- Use Reddit-appropriate casual language
- Never pressure or push any specific solution
- Keep the company mentions natural and contextual

PRIORITIZE AUTHENTICITY AND VALUE. Most threads should score 30-60 unless they're perfect matches.`
