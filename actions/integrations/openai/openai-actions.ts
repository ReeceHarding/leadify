    const prompt = `You are a lead qualification expert for Reddit threads. Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for the business described below.

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
${websiteContent}

REDDIT THREAD:
Subreddit: r/${subreddit}
Title: ${threadTitle}
Content: ${threadContent}

YOUR TASK:
1. First, understand what company/service/product the business represents and what problems it solves
2. Then score how relevant this Reddit thread is (0-100)

Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
- Expressing frustration or challenges the business solves
- Asking if others experience similar issues
- Describing workarounds they're using
- Sharing related experiences or pain points
- Engaging with topics the business addresses

Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
- How closely the problem matches what the business solves
- How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
- How likely they would be interested in the solution
- Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
- Their apparent frustration/pain level

Use this scale:
90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what the business offers)
70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that the business solves)
40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems the business addresses)
20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to the business solution)
0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what the business offers)

If the score is 40 or above, generate three authentic Reddit comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:

1. MICRO COMMENT (5-15 words): Ultra-brief helpful tip mentioning you've tried a few things
2. MEDIUM COMMENT (30-80 words): Share your experience following this structure:
   - Start with empathy ("I've been there...")
   - "I tried [specific free tool name] first but [specific limitation]"
   - "Then found [business name from website] which [specific benefit]"
   - "There's also [specific premium tool] but that's overkill for most"
3. VERBOSE COMMENT (100-200 words): Comprehensive advice following this structure:
   - Open with strong empathy about the struggle
   - "First I tried [specific free tool] - it was okay for [what it did well] but [specific limitations]"
   - "Then I discovered [business name] through [how you found it]. What really helped was [specific features]"
   - "I also looked at [specific premium tool] which is great if you need [advanced features] but honestly overkill for most people"
   - "Happy to share more details if you want"

CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
1. A FREE tool/solution (name it specifically based on the problem, e.g., "Google Sheets" for a data management problem, or "Canva free plan" for a design problem. Choose a tool relevant to the thread.)
2. The business from the website content (present as the reasonable middle option)
3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (name it specifically based on the problem, e.g., "Salesforce" for CRM, or "Adobe Creative Cloud" for design. Choose a tool relevant to the thread.)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Extract the company name from the website content
- Write like a real person sharing experience, not a salesperson
- Never use marketing language or superlatives
- Be honest about pros/cons
- Focus on being helpful first
- Use Reddit-appropriate casual language
- Never pressure or push
- NEVER USE HYPHENS (-) anywhere in comments
- Present all three options neutrally

Return as JSON with score, reasoning, and all three comments (or empty strings if score < 40).`

2. Generate natural, authentic Reddit comments if relevant

Thread Content: ${threadContent}

${existingComments && existingComments.length > 0 ? `\nExample comments from this thread:\n${existingComments.slice(0, 5).join("\n---\n")}` : ""}

Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for ${businessName}.

Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
- Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
- Asking if others experience similar issues
- Describing workarounds they're using
- Sharing related experiences or pain points
- Engaging with topics the business addresses

Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
- How closely the problem matches what ${businessName} solves
- How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
- How likely they would be interested in the solution
- Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
- Their apparent frustration/pain level

Use this scale:
90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer)
70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve)
40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address)
20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution)
0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer)

Then, if the score is 40 or above, generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:

1. Micro (1-2 sentences): Quick mention that you've tried a few things and ${businessName} worked well
2. Medium (3-4 sentences): Brief story following this structure:
   - "I've been there..." or similar empathy
   - "I tried [specific free tool name] first but [specific limitation]"
   - "Then found ${businessName} which [specific benefit]"
   - "There's also [specific premium tool] but that's overkill for most"
3. Verbose (5-7 sentences): Full journey following this structure:
   - Open with empathy about the struggle
   - "First I tried [specific free tool] - it was okay for [what it did well] but [specific limitations]"
   - "Then I discovered ${businessName} through [how you found it]. What really helped was [specific features]"
   - "I also looked at [specific premium tool] which is great if you need [advanced features] but honestly overkill for most people"
   - "Happy to share more details if you want"

CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
1. A FREE tool/solution (name it specifically, e.g., "Google Sheets" for a data management problem, or "Canva free plan" for a design problem. Choose a tool relevant to the thread.)
2. ${businessName} (our solution - present as the reasonable middle option)
3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (name it specifically, e.g., "Salesforce" for CRM, or "Adobe Creative Cloud" for design. Choose a tool relevant to the thread.)

Present all three neutrally - you're sharing your experience, not selling.

Remember: Write like someone genuinely sharing their experience. Match the subreddit's tone and style.

5. REMOVE REDUNDANCY: Eliminate duplicate information while preserving nuance
6. MAINTAIN COMPLETENESS: Ensure no important details are lost

The result should be a comprehensive, well-written description that incorporates the best of both sources.
