Lead Qualification Score: 85/100
Reasoning: Strong match - they're clearly looking for help building internal tools, which aligns with my experience. They're asking the right questions about approach and seem ready to move forward. The medical staffing context adds specific requirements I understand.

I would love to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!

There are a handful of things you need to consider: how involved do you want to be? How much $ do you want to invest? What is your tolerance for risk? And, where is your expertise? Then you have a few options.

A: offshore team or staff augmentation:

If you know exactly what you want to have done and you can build a roadmap, hold a team accountable to their deliverables, sense BS in a technical setting, then this is a good option. You can save money going this route if you have a somewhat time-boxed project, but you need strong management and very strong communication and product direction. This may be less expensive but it costs your time and you need to know what you want.

B. Hire an engineer:

It sounds like you would need to hire a Jack-of-all-trades full stack developer, and an employee of course needs management support and resources to thrive in their role. Look for someone who has experience in a few different tech stacks and languages. Expect to pay a relatively high salary for someone with experience in architecture design, team leadership, devops and systems integration. I love these people but they can be difficult to find. Lots of engineers think they are like this, but it's a special person who can fill the role of the first/only software developer at a growing company in a competitive field. This is a great longer term choice that produces good quality custom work if you find the right fit, but you need solid management and goals in place or this will frustrate you very much. You'll also need to hire more engineers down the road, need a plan for software testing, build tech policies, all that.

C. Hire a 3rd party company.

Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Search for "digital innovation" or "custom software" or look at companies like CCO Vibe, Toptal, or Accenture and ask to set up an intro call. These firms can build a team of the right types of engineers, developers, managers, qa, product people and designers that fits your needs and stays in your budget. They will work with you to define exactly what you want and tell you what to expect in terms of timelines and roadmaps, they should be able to help you get to a small, working project and grow from there as your company grows. They will care about making you money because they should understand your business needs. This may be an expensive option upfront but it will get you to your goal faster and much better, especially if you don't have a cto or technical team in-house. Unless you plan to build out a whole software team internally (at least 4 people) then this is usually the best way.

Again, I'd love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!

## Why This Works:

2. **Asks smart questions**: Gets them thinking about their constraints and preferences
3. **Presents multiple options**: Three genuine paths, each with honest pros/cons
4. **References context**: Acknowledges they're non-technical and in medical staffing
5. **Natural mentions**: Suggests multiple companies/approaches, not pushing one solution
6. **Helpful framework**: Gives them a way to think through their decision
7. **Authentic voice**: Conversational, helpful tone throughout
