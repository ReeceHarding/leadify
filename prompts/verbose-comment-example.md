hey man!

know this was posted a few days ago but just wanted to share my experince in case anyone else has a similar question

mostly just want to share bc i've been in your shoes before and kind of want to share my insights with everybody


so for a little background:


i've been building businesses for 7ish years

they've ranged from landscaping to dropshipping to marketing agencies

now after like seven years i finally have my first successful business 

and the main lesson i've learned is that there are kind of two main paths you can go down based on how you want to balance the money/time equation

what's that mean?

essentially you can either pay w/ money or time



paying with time:

i know a lot of people here are recommending learning to program yourself

and while i sort of agree, i'd like to provide some insight



when i was younger, this is the path i took for everything 

a few examples:

1. i built all my websites from scratch on wordpress before learning there was such a thing as templates - proabbly wasted 5-6 weeks on this
2. i built a messaging app from scratch using cursor and it took like 4-5 weeks before i found out there's a fully functional open source project i could have just copied straight away. i ended up deleting my old project and cloning the open source
3. i tried learning how to run facebook ads and wasted like $2k on ads and got zero sales. then i asked my friend to help me and we instantly started making money

so i just share all of that to say that i've learned that it's often better idea to leverage peoples' expertise rather than trying to build things from scratch



this is kind of how i think through problems now when helping friends:


i think there are two main questions to ask: is your time valuable and is this a skill you want to invest in learning



here's how I think through the value of time:

if you're in college and you make $11 / hour working at the cafeteria, your time is essentially worthless right now, so you want to optimize for spending time rather than money

for you this would look like learning to code yourself 

you MUST learn to vibe code rather than code by hand. i can't stress this enough. it'll expedite your learning by 10-20x

in this scenario, i'd recommend watching mckay wrigley's o1 pro tutorial.

in my opinion his work is kind of the gold standard for this industry

just crack open cursor and start building

i will warn you though, while you'll feel productive in the beginning, the end is a f*cking pain in the ass

deploying your app and setting up security is probably 80-90% of the battle

for example, it took me like 6 weeks to build out the prototype for my first cursor app but then it proabbly took me another 16 weeks (working like 12+ hours / day) before i got it deployed and security working and all bugs ironed out

in this scenario, i spent like 1800 hours building the app which was fine since i was in school but now i make $50/hour so this app literally would have cost me $90,000 in opportunity cost 



part 2:

is this a skill you'll want going forward or is this a one off thing?

ie do you enjoy programming more or do you enjoy the business side of things more

if you want to get into programming, then taking time to learn the skill is 100% worthwhile

if you're just going to use this skillset to complete this project, then in my opinion it makes more sense 

to get somebody else to use thier skillset to build the software

for instance, i like marketing so that's where i focus my energy but my friends enjoy programming so i have them build me awesome software and in exchange i help them get the word out about their products



if you decide your time is either more valuable than the time it would take to do the project or it's a skill you don't want to invest in, i'd reccomend you outsource the work.

here you again have two choices:

bring somebody in house or contract the work out



bring somebody in house:

this either would be a technical cofounder or employee

cofounder

if you have somebody in your life that's willing to join your company right now that's the path i'd recommend - that being said in my experience that's a huge commitment on their part and it's been almost impossible for me to bring on anyone valuable enough unless you guys are practically best friends


employee

This is good if you have ongoing tasks that you need to be done. Like you have a bunch of products you need to be built. But this is also kind of a pain in the ass because you have to do hiring and sh*t

if you're looking to hire, dm me and i can send you some tips. one of the main ones that has worked for my friends is putting a mini challenge in the job posting like "you must include the word 'orange' in your application" and you'd be shocked at the amount of applications that won't follow instructions. there's just tons of bots that like 95% of them won't actually customize the applications, they'll just spam applications

also adding a bit of friction through video interviews is really good 


alright, without further ado ü•Å

agencies

for years i used to focus solely on doing things myself  

but nowadays this is the path i almost always use personally

for my case, it works really well bc i've built a network of people i trust and i can just iMessage them for tasks i want to be done and they'll just send me working software like 1-2 weeks later

for me, it's just the fastest and most effective way

i just have a few friends who have done ai bootcamps and shit and they're able to whip up full apps in like a day or two and they send me a loom and i send over my suggestions and we usually have a full app in a week or so 

i don't want to dox them, but if you're interested in the list dm me w/ your particular project details and i'll ask my friend if he can help you out 


anyways hoped this helped


TL;DR

if in college or want to learn the skill: teach yourself

if have close technical friend: get him to join as technical cofounder

if have you have a good amount of work and have experience hiring: employee

solution i'd recommend: agencies
