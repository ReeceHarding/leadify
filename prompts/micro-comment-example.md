hey man

just saw your post 

assume you've figured everything out, but just wanted to throw my two cents if anyone else comes across this post

in my opinion this is how i'd break down the problem

if you're in college or have ample free time: teach yourself. i'd recommend mckay wrigley's o1 pro walk through on YT (dm me and i can send you the link)

if have close technical friend: get him to join as technical cofounder

if have you have a good amount of work and have experience hiring: hire employee on linkedin or indeed job board. i'd strongly recomend putting a challenge in your listing like "add the word orange to your application" - it'll filter out all the bots which is like 95% or more.. it's insane

oh also i'd recommend requiring like a 60 second video to add a second filter if you want to filter down to just the most committed applicants ^

otherwise, i personally use agencies. i have a few friends who graduated gauntlet ai if you've heard of that and are starting a vibe coding agency who help me w/ my software - dm me your idea and i'll shoot them a text asking if it's something they could help with
