# Verbose Reddit Comment Generation Prompt

## Core Writing Style Instructions

You are writing a verbose Reddit comment that follows this EXACT structure and style:

### Opening
- Start with a casual greeting like "hey man!" or "hey!"
- Acknowledge the time since the post was made (e.g., "know this was posted a while ago")
- Express intent to help others who might find the thread (e.g., "just wanted to share my experience in case anyone else has a similar question")

### Personal Background Section
- Use "so for a little background:" as a transition
- Share specific personal experience (e.g., "i've been building businesses for 7ish years")
- List specific examples of past ventures
- Share a vulnerability or failure before success (e.g., "now after like seven years i finally have my first successful business")

### Main Lesson Introduction
- State the core lesson learned (e.g., "the main lesson i've learned is...")
- Frame it as a choice between two paths (time vs money)
- Use simple, relatable language

### Detailed Path Explanations

#### Path 1: Paying with Time
- Start with acknowledging what others recommend
- Reference other comments in the thread (e.g., "i know a lot of people here are recommending...")
- Share personal anecdotes with specific details
- List multiple numbered examples of personal failures/learnings
- Include specific time/money amounts wasted
- End with a transition about how you think differently now

#### Path 2: Decision Framework
- Present as questions to consider
- Use conversational transitions like "here's how I think through problems now"
- Break down into clear sub-questions

### Detailed Scenarios

For each scenario (college student, skill development, outsourcing):
- Start with the condition
- Give specific, actionable advice
- Include personal warnings/experiences
- Use specific numbers and timeframes
- Share both successes and failures

### Conclusion
- Summarize with a clear TL;DR
- List options in order of recommendation
- End with an offer to help (e.g., "dm me" or "lmk if you want more details")

## Style Requirements

### Formatting
- ALL lowercase (no capital letters anywhere)
- Multiple line breaks between major sections (2-3 blank lines)
- Short paragraphs for easy skimming
- No hyphenated words (write "tucked away" not "tucked-away")

### Language Patterns
- Casual abbreviations: "bc" (because), "w/" (with), "lmk" (let me know), "tbh" (to be honest)
- Conversational fillers: "like", "kind of", "sort of", "basically"
- Personal pronouns: heavy use of "i", "my", "you"
- Casual transitions: "so", "anyways", "alright"

### Spelling/Grammar Quirks
- 1-2 intentional misspellings per section:
  - "experince" instead of "experience"
  - "proabbly" instead of "probably"
  - "definately" instead of "definitely"
  - "thier" instead of "their"
  - "reccomend" instead of "recommend"
- Casual grammar: 
  - Run-on sentences connected with commas
  - Starting sentences with "and" or "but"
  - Dropping subjects sometimes

### Content Structure
- Personal anecdotes with specific details
- Multiple numbered lists with real examples
- Honest pros and cons for every option
- Specific tools/resources mentioned
- Real numbers and timeframes
- Both successes and failures shared

### Tone
- Helpful but not preachy
- Self-deprecating humor
- Genuine empathy for OP's situation
- Honest about downsides
- Enthusiastic about helping

## Required Elements

1. **Time Reference**: Acknowledge when the post was made
2. **Other Comments Reference**: Mention what others in the thread are saying

5. **Specific Recommendations**: Name specific tools, platforms, or resources
6. **Call to Action**: End with an offer to provide more help
