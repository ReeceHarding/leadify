WEBSITE CONTENT (the company's homepage):
${mockWebsiteContent}

REDDIT THREAD:
Title: ${thread.title}
Content: ${thread.content}

TASK:
1. Score this Reddit thread from 1-100 on how relevant it is for the company to mention they're the CEO and personally recommend reaching out for help.
2. Generate a helpful, authentic comment that the CEO could post.

SCORING CRITERIA (1-100):
- 90-100: Perfect match - thread is directly asking for the company's services
- 70-89: High relevance - thread problem aligns well with company's solutions
- 50-69: Medium relevance - some connection but not ideal
- 30-49: Low relevance - weak connection
- 1-29: Not relevant - no clear connection

COMMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Sound authentic and helpful, not salesy
- Mention being a CEO naturally in context
- Offer genuine value/help
- Include a soft call-to-action to reach out
- Keep it conversational and Reddit-appropriate
- Maximum 200 words

Please respond with a JSON object with this exact structure:

  "score": [number from 1-100],

  "generatedComment": "[the comment text]"
