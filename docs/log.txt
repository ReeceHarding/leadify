[2025-05-28T21:07:15.092Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.092Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.092Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, with a mix of **supportive and cautionary** advice. The commenters express a willingness to help and share their expertise, but they also emphasize the potential pitfalls and challenges of software development. There is a sense of camaraderie among the commenters, as they engage in a discussion about a common topic.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.092Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.092Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is generally straightforward and accessible, avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary. There are instances of **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "sense BS in a technical setting," "love this exploratory phase") that contribute to the informal tone. Some comments include **abbreviations** (e.g., "CTO" for Chief Technology Officer) and industry-specific terms (e.g., "full stack developer," "devops"), indicating a familiarity with the subject matter.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.093Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.093Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with some being quite brief (a few sentences) while others are more detailed and structured, often resembling mini-essays. The longer comments tend to break down complex ideas into sections (A, B, C), making them easier to digest.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.093Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.093Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is predominantly **casual**, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or conversational phrasing. While most comments are coherent and well-structured, they do not adhere strictly to formal grammar rules. For example, the use of ellipses, informal punctuation, and direct address (e.g., "I would *love* to chat") contributes to a relaxed style.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.093Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **How People Give Recommendations**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.093Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Recommendations are typically framed with a **cautious tone**, often prefaced by considerations of the user's specific situation (e.g., budget, expertise, project complexity). Commenters frequently use phrases like "it depends on" or "you may want to" to indicate that their advice is not one-size-fits-all. They provide multiple options (A, B, C) and outline the pros and cons of each, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to problem-solving. Additionally, there is an emphasis on the importance of management and communication, suggesting that successful software development requires more than just technical skills.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.093Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Overall, the comments reflect a community of knowledgeable individuals willing to share their insights while also highlighting the complexities of software development. The tone is friendly and encouraging, aimed at helping the original poster navigate their project effectively.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, with a mix of **supportive and cautionary** advice. The commenters express a willingness to help and share their expertise, but they also emphasize the potential pitfalls and challenges of software development. There is a sense of camaraderie among the commenters, as they engage in a discussion about a common topic.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is generally straightforward and accessible, avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary. There are instances of **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "sense BS in a technical setting," "love this exploratory phase") that contribute to the informal tone. Some comments include **abbreviations** (e.g., "CTO" for Chief Technology Officer) and industry-specific terms (e.g., "full stack developer," "devops"), indicating a familiarity with the subject matter.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with some being quite brief (a few sentences) while others are more detailed and structured, often resembling mini-essays. The longer comments tend to break down complex ideas into sections (A, B, C), making them easier to digest.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is predominantly **casual**, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or conversational phrasing. While most comments are coherent and well-structured, they do not adhere strictly to formal grammar rules. For example, the use of ellipses, informal punctuation, and direct address (e.g., "I would *love* to chat") contributes to a relaxed style.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **How People Give Recommendations**:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Recommendations are typically framed with a **cautious tone**, often prefaced by considerations of the user's specific situation (e.g., budget, expertise, project complexity). Commenters frequently use phrases like "it depends on" or "you may want to" to indicate that their advice is not one-size-fits-all. They provide multiple options (A, B, C) and outline the pros and cons of each, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to problem-solving. Additionally, there is an emphasis on the importance of management and communication, suggesting that successful software development requires more than just technical skills.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Overall, the comments reflect a community of knowledgeable individuals willing to share their insights while also highlighting the complexities of software development. The tone is friendly and encouraging, aimed at helping the original poster navigate their project effectively.

[2025-05-28T21:07:15.095Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My employer is tasking me with looking into and ultimately employing someone to build company specific software for our different departments. The sector we work in is Medical Staffing (so think recruiting, scheduling, finance).
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.096Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am not well versed in this field, so any help to the following would be amazing.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.096Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Wouldn’t the nature of such request be better suited for a company with a development team and not necessarily an individual?
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.096Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. What is the job title I should be researching? Software developer, programmer, etc?
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.096Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is the start of the journey for us, we are a small business. I understand this may seem naive but every company has to start somewhere, so I’m trying to gain as much helpful information and resources possible so that I can help guide us properly.

[2025-05-28T21:07:15.097Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: 1. It depends on the size of the projects, timelines, budget and expected quality (keeping in mind not all large firms produce timely (nor sometimes quality) code/software.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.097Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Software developer is a broad term, so you’d likely (partly to ensure quality, partly to find the right people generally) need to search for the programming language expected, or someone with experience making similar products. The former of these is harder if you’re not a software developer, but it’s often good to look around at existing similar systems and understand what languages they use, pros and cons, and go from there, but this approach isn’t entirely necessary, it depends on how much time/interest you have!
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.097Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: How did it go? Very curious to see how things went since it's been a year!

[2025-05-28T21:07:15.097Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. "I would *love* to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a handful of things you need to consider: how involved do you want to be? How much $ do you want to invest? What is your tolerance for risk? And, where is your expertise? Then you have a few options.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A: offshore team or staff augmentation:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you know exactly what you want to have done and you can build a roadmap, hold a team accountable to their deliverables, sense BS in a technical setting, then this is a good option. You can save money going this route if you have a somewhat time-boxed project, but you need strong management and very strong communication and product direction. This may be less expensive but it costs your time and you need to know what you want.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: B. Hire an engineer:
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It sounds like you would need to hire a Jack-of-all-trades full stack developer, and an employee of course needs management support and resources to thrive in their role. Look for someone who has experience in a few different tech stacks and languages. Expect to pay a relatively high salary for someone with experience in architecture design, team leadership, devops and systems integration. I love these people but they can be difficult to find. Lots of engineers _think_ they are like this, but it’s a special person who can fill the role of the first/only software developer at a growing company in a competitive field. This is a great longer term choice that produces good quality custom work if you find the right fit, but you need solid management and goals in place or this will frustrate you very much. You’ll also need to hire more engineers down the road, need a plan for software testing, build tech policies, all that.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: C. Hire a 3rd party company.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Search for “digital innovation” or “custom software” or look at “beaugmented.ai” and ask to set up an intro call. These firms can build a team of the right types of engineers, developers, managers, qa, product people and designers that fits your needs and stays in your budget. They will work with you to define exactly what you want and tell you what to expect in terms of timelines and roadmaps, they should be able to help you get to a small, working project and grow from there as your company grows. They will care about making you money because they should understand your business needs. This may be an expensive option upfront but it will get you to your goal faster and much better, especially if you don’t have a cto or technical team in-house. Unless you plan to build out a whole software team internally (at least 4 people) then this is usually the best way.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Again, I’d love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!"
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. "You...may want to employ a company that makes line of business software.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It depends on how complex your needs are.
[2025-05-28T21:07:15.100Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would recommend against just hiring a solitary programmer and expecting the moon. First, likely the programmer has gaps in their knowledge. If not, they are likely either very expensive or very inexperienced (and faking it). Finally, having someone test their own work is bad practice."

[2025-05-28T21:07:29.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-RESULT] Medium Comment: Since you are a small business in a market like medical staffing, you have a few options. One is to hire an experienced full stack developer, but keep in mind that you may need technical leadership to guide them. Another is to work with a company that builds custom business software. A solution like cco vibe could work well if you need a faster turnaround and cost efficiency. Each approach has its trade-offs in time and risk, so choose based on how involved you want to be and your budget.

[2025-05-28T21:07:29.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-RESULT] Verbose Comment: I know this may seem overwhelming at first, but you have a few options to consider for building software for your different departments. In your case, since you are in medical staffing and need solutions for recruiting, scheduling, and finance, option one is to hire an experienced full stack developer. However, note that an individual might have gaps in their expertise. This individual would need to be comfortable with everything from building the database to designing efficient user interfaces and managing projects. Not only do you have to manage the work, but also support them with a clear vision and technical guidance.
[2025-05-28T21:07:29.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Option two is to work with a company that specializes in building custom business software. Several commenters have already mentioned how working with a company may help fill in areas like quality assurance and design. Firms similar to cco vibe, which build internal tools using AI, can offer fast delivery and more cost efficient pricing compared to traditional programming methods. This option can reduce your risk if you do not have an internal technical team, and they are better positioned to provide real time project management and accountability.
[2025-05-28T21:07:29.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The third option is to consider an offshore team if you have a strong leader who can define a clear product roadmap and manage the communications. This can be cost efficient but usually requires more management effort on your part and a tolerance for some potential delays or differences in work style.
[2025-05-28T21:07:29.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In practice, many small businesses in similar sectors choose to work with a product company because that lets them focus on their core business of medical staffing while letting experts handle the tech development. I suggest having a clear idea of your goals, asking plenty of questions during initial calls, and considering whether you want to take on the management of a technical hire or outsource entirely. I am happy to discuss further if you want to bounce ideas or need more clarity on any of these options.
