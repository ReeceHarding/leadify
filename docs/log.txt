# Terminal Command Logs

This file captures all terminal command outputs from the Leadify project.
It gets cleared automatically when `npm run dev` is started to provide a fresh log for each development session.

The logging system captures:
- Command start/finish times with timestamps
- All stdout and stderr output
- Exit codes and error information
- Process interruptions and terminations

This comprehensive log can be fed to AI models for debugging and analysis purposes.
