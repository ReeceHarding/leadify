[2025-05-28T21:37:20.285Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.285Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.285Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informative and pragmatic**. While some comments are more direct and cautionary (e.g., "Don't, it will not work out"), others are supportive and encouraging (e.g., "I would *love* to chat about this"). The tone varies from slightly skeptical to enthusiastic, reflecting a mix of caution and eagerness to help.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is predominantly **professional and technical**, reflecting a familiarity with software development concepts. There is minimal use of slang or abbreviations, although some informal expressions (e.g., "I’d love to chat") are present. The comments often include specific terminology related to software development, such as "full stack developer," "architecture design," and "devops," indicating a knowledgeable audience.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being quite **concise** (e.g., the first comment) and others being **detailed and extensive** (e.g., the longer response outlining different hiring options). This suggests that commenters tailor their responses based on the complexity of the question and their desire to provide thorough advice.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual but coherent**. While some comments are well-structured with complete sentences and proper punctuation, others may be more conversational and less formal.

[2025-05-28T21:37:20.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **How People Give Recommendations**:
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Recommendations are often framed with **caution and context**. Commenters typically provide a rationale for their advice, highlighting potential pitfalls (e.g., "I would recommend against just hiring a solitary programmer") and suggesting alternative approaches (e.g., hiring a team or a third-party company). This method of providing recommendations reflects a desire to guide the original poster thoughtfully, emphasizing the importance of understanding their specific needs and circumstances.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a handful of things you need to consider: how involved do you want to be? How much $ do you want to invest? What is your tolerance for risk? And, where is your expertise? Then you have a few options.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A: offshore team or staff augmentation:
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you know exactly what you want to have done and you can build a roadmap, hold a team accountable to their deliverables, sense BS in a technical setting, then this is a good option. You can save money going this route if you have a somewhat time-boxed project, but you need strong management and very strong communication and product direction. This may be less expensive but it costs your time and you need to know what you want.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: B. Hire an engineer:
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It sounds like you would need to hire a Jack-of-all-trades full stack developer, and an employee of course needs management support and resources to thrive in their role. Look for someone who has experience in a few different tech stacks and languages. Expect to pay a relatively high salary for someone with experience in architecture design, team leadership, devops and systems integration. I love these people but they can be difficult to find. Lots of engineers _think_ they are like this, but it’s a special person who can fill the role of the first/only software developer at a growing company in a competitive field. This is a great longer term choice that produces good quality custom work if you find the right fit, but you need solid management and goals in place or this will frustrate you very much. You’ll also need to hire more engineers down the road, need a plan for software testing, build tech policies, all that.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: C. Hire a 3rd party company.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Search for “digital innovation” or “custom software” or look at “beaugmented.ai” and ask to set up an intro call. These firms can build a team of the right types of engineers, developers, managers, qa, product people and designers that fits your needs and stays in your budget. They will work with you to define exactly what you want and tell you what to expect in terms of timelines and roadmaps, they should be able to help you get to a small, working project and grow from there as your company grows. They will care about making you money because they should understand your business needs. This may be an expensive option upfront but it will get you to your goal faster and much better, especially if you don’t have a cto or technical team in-house. Unless you plan to build out a whole software team internally (at least 4 people) then this is usually the best way.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Again, I’d love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!"
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. "You...may want to employ a company that makes line of business software.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It depends on how complex your needs are.
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would recommend against just hiring a solitary programmer and expecting the moon. First, likely the programmer has gaps in their knowledge. If not, they are likely either very expensive or very inexperienced (and faking it). Finally, having someone test their own work is bad practice."
[2025-05-28T21:37:20.293Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS:

[2025-05-28T21:37:40.069Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.069Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **casual and conversational**. The users share personal experiences and insights in a friendly manner, often using first-person narratives.

[2025-05-28T21:37:40.069Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is informal, with the use of **slang, abbreviations, and colloquial expressions**. Phrases like "kudos," "you get what you are paying for," and "cheers to all!" contribute to the casual tone. There are also instances of **direct address** (e.g., "Hope your experience is just as easy"), which fosters a sense of dialogue among users. Some comments also include **specific jargon** related to hiring developers and project management.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.069Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:

[2025-05-28T21:37:40.069Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **How People Give Recommendations**:
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.069Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Recommendations are often framed as **personal anecdotes** or experiences, which adds credibility and relatability. Users typically share both positive and negative aspects of their experiences, providing a balanced view.

[2025-05-28T21:37:40.070Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.070Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient.

[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Here are some options I am considering:
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Upwork, Fiverr
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Google

[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: Figure out what "good" means for your team - seniority, specific languages? Having that clear vision, our CEO consulted with Lemon.io, and kudos to them. It went stress-free all the way. Hope your experience is just as easy
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: When I want to hire someone, I usually find them through Reddit, I go into subs specific for what I need to hire, then I look for the person who adds the most value via comments. I reach out to 10-15 redditors and usually hire from there.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It has never failed me in over 40 hires.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I used Fiverr to make a simple CLICKER/IDLE game and the cost was 1,500 USD with all set up and running in the GooglePlayStore.  As many people have mentioned using Fivver is a " Hit or Miss" as dar as quality development.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My experience working with the Developer from Fivver was not bad but you will have to look at many portfolios and try ask questions to decipher WHO , appears to have the knowledge to bring to life your project.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I can say that price range varies and its backed by the developer's experience for the most part. I seen some work that I liked but the prices are based on same great work. I am onna budget so I went with basically one of the cheapest  developer's for my project.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Things to keep in mind... you get what you are paying for literally. The European and Americans appear to charge the most because of skills and so I opted to go with a cheaper PAKISTANI developer.  Things to keep in mind if opting for cheaper routes.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TIME ZONE DIFFERENCE: I had free time between the hours of 2am till 5am and in Pakistan it was afternoon,  so this worked out well in my case.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: LANGUAGE BARRIER: during vetting process asking questions will allow to get a feel for the developer's English speaking and compression. My developer was having poor grammar in English but made up for it with SUPER quick responses and example; when I logged into game I can then say hey man you spelled these words wrong , spell it like this.....he would quickly go and fix spelling so language for me was not a huge issue.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: WORK ETHIC  : here is where things get dicey and basically I recommend to break your project down in sections or Phases. Example;  when I spieled my apps plan and gameplay he quoted me 1,500 dollars and I agreed. Next I broke the apps vision in 3 phases.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: PAYMENT: I used the in app Fiverr payment system and everything was fine. I paid 500 dollars and gave developer EXACTLY what I wished for...... after 1 week he produced the results then asked me for a revision  or 2 and when I was happy I then pay him 500 dollars in Fiverr for Phase 2 then 500 for final phase 3
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Conclusion; I would use service again but my game was Idle/clicker very easy. These 3 sections  I completed basically completes  CHAPTER/PHASE  1 of the entire game that when finished will take another 2 phases. Its important to have EVERYTHING ready for these low price developer's because the price point will not allow them to be or want to be creative and spend more time than they have to on your project and therefore being ready and knowing exactly what you want is key.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Last advise, in last phase and last revisions TAKE YOUR TIME trying to find bugs. Click on everything,  enjoy game, reset and basically tinker ,tinker , tinker to find as many bugs for it to be fixed in final and ultimate revision.  I failed this step and it will cost me about 2 or 3 hundred dollars to fix. Example of bug I did not catch during revision ; when you scuba dive to collect gold then when you upgrade the TILE to level 2 the tile would change to a more advanced TILE but the ( bug) I did not catch was that the ( Level marker still would say LEVEL 1 TILE instead of changing to LEVEL 2 because the tile was upgraded and looks better and nicer but it would still say underneath Level 1
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: All in all, its doable to make a low price app on Fivver but you must know ALL details and have alot patience as most Devs are foreign speaking languages.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.071Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Cheers to all !

Its important to have EVERYTHING ready for these low price developer's because the price point will not allow them to be or want to be creative and spend more time than they have to on your project and therefore being ready and knowing exactly what you want is key.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.074Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Last advise, in last phase and last revisions TAKE YOUR TIME trying to find bugs. Click on everything,  enjoy game, reset and basically tinker ,tinker , tinker to find as many bugs for it to be fixed in final and ultimate revision.  I failed this step and it will cost me about 2 or 3 hundred dollars to fix. Example of bug I did not catch during revision ; when you scuba dive to collect gold then when you upgrade the TILE to level 2 the tile would change to a more advanced TILE but the ( bug) I did not catch was that the ( Level marker still would say LEVEL 1 TILE instead of changing to LEVEL 2 because the tile was upgraded and looks better and nicer but it would still say underneath Level 1

[2025-05-28T21:37:40.074Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. "Most things on Fiverr are a crap shoot. Upwork can be the same but maybe a bit better. I would always suggest looking over the developers portfolio and asking them about the process they use. Things like how the workflow works. This can be a quick way to weed out some of the bottom tier developers.
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.074Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What are you looking to develop? I may be able to give you better direction on where to look."
[2025-05-28T21:37:40.074Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. "What's your budget or the assumed budget of the competition? Above a certain budget I'd think you'd want to find a vendor or shop instead of dealing with independent contractors on sites like upwork. FWIW depending on the scope of your project I'd say look on subreddits like experienced devs."

[2025-05-28T21:37:57.243Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-28T21:37:57.244Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I would suggest you make a document/slides that would explain your idea. What you are trying to solve, who are your target customers, references the developer can look at to understand how this idea works (if there are existing apps that are already doing your idea), and what features you are thinking of to be part of the MVP.
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.244Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then you can start looking for developers that can help you make the idea into reality.
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.244Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you are thinking of making the app available for both Android and iOS, I would suggest looking for Mobile Developers who knows React Native, a framework that allows developers to use the same code to publish apps for both Android and iOS.
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.244Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can look for developers via LinkedIn, Upwork, Fiverr, or just googling. Posting on subreddits like this helps as well.
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.244Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I found my developers on Upwork after posting a detailed description of what I want + provided design
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.244Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I think the wireframes or low quality design is great to the success of any project before engaging developers or even designers. You will be surprised how many times you will change your mind about some features/layouts.
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.244Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For me to de-risk the process I got a UX guy to do the designs for the app (paid them $15/hour) and I got a specialist to advise on the best "Tech stack" so I won't be taken on a ride with the developers.
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.244Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: From my experience developers work better if you provide your design. Adobe XD is free and it has free templates that you can use, so get started. There are plenty of other wireframing/prototype apps out there that you can also use.

[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. "Right here!"
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. "First things first, do you need a developer or an app agency? Yes, that's where you start. A freelance app developer will be ideal for your project if you're starting and have limited funds. However, if you're seeking to build an enterprise-class app, you should consider hiring a full-fledged agency for your project."
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS:
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. CONNECT WITH THEIR SITUATION LIKE A REAL PERSON
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - What problem are they actually trying to solve?
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - What constraints did they mention (budget, timeline, team, experience)?
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - What's their context? (industry, business stage, what they've tried)
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How does this connect to your own experience?
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - What would you personally want to know if you were in their shoes?
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. READ THE ROOM LIKE A HUMAN
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - What has the conversation covered already?
[2025-05-28T21:37:57.246Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - What are people missing or getting wrong?

[2025-05-28T21:38:18.398Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.398Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.398Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informative and advisory**. Contributors provide practical advice and share their experiences in a straightforward manner. While some comments maintain a degree of professionalism, the tone is generally **conversational**, reflecting a community-oriented approach typical of Reddit discussions. There is also an undercurrent of **caution**, especially when discussing the risks of hiring developers from certain regions or platforms.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.398Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.398Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is predominantly **technical**, with specific jargon related to software development and hiring practices (e.g., "development methodology," "source control," "Agile development process").
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.398Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is a mix of **formal and informal language**, with some comments using phrases like "PM me" (private message me) and "you don’t want them," which adds a casual touch.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.398Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Abbreviations and acronyms** (e.g., "PM," "BS") are common, reflecting the familiarity of the audience with the subject matter.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business.

[2025-05-28T21:38:18.400Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hi, I am leading a small team of 4 people and we was developing a small workflow automation tool. Unfortunately our lead developer had to part way from us for certain reasons. Apparently he wanted to begin his venture. It was quite sad for me but I figured that I should respect his decision.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.400Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For that reason I am planning to find a new developer. But that COVID-19 situation made me unable to meet new people in person. Then I decided to try hiring freelancers but honestly I am not sure if it would work well.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.400Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I used to hire a freelance designer via Fiverr to help designing a logo. But that is too different than hiring a developers. Therefore I would like to ask if there is anyone has hired freelance developer before?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.400Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I wish to know where is the good source to find quality developers. And also what should I pay attention to when hiring freelance developers?

[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: Have a look for contributors to GitHub and Stackoverflow. Maybe look for solution to a question you already have solved in your project.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Hiring Development resources is tough, and getting scammed or ripped off is pretty easy on sites such as Fiverr or Upwork.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'd suggest going through an agency and getting a dedicated vetted engineer for your team. Not as cheap, but much higher quality and over site.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Disclaimers: I started 3 startups with that model, and now I run an agency that provides that after seeing how it worked with us. PM me if you need more info.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: If you're not technical yourself then it'll be very hard for you to judge the competency of developer, especially if they're not honest with you. The best thing that you can do it to require them to provide references for previous clients who they've done similar work for, and then to speak to those clients about their experience with the developers.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Some questions you can ask to try and identify the difference between proper developers and people who can write code (although be aware that if you don't understand these concept, they can probably just BS you):
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What development methodology do they follow?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do they manage source control?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Do they use tests as part of the development process?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do they backup their code?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What documentation will they provide alongside the code?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What secure development practices do they use?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One of the biggest issues is a mismatch in expectations between the two sides when outsourcing development. Before speaking to them, you need to be clear on:
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What are your functional requirements?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What are your non-functional requirements?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you verify that the developed software meets these requirements?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What is are your deadlines (and are they realistic)?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What is your budget?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What happens if the project goes overbudget or overtime? Are you paying per hour, or a fixed price for the work?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What happens if you make changes to the original design or what additional features added?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Do you require ongoing support, or do they deliver the tool and then you're done?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What about fixing bugs?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Will your receive the source code alongside the working tools? What about documentation, build scripts and instructions, etc?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What level of security do you need for the tool? How will the developers provide this? If it needs third party testing, who will pay?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will the delivery process work? Will you get given the software at the end of the process, or will they provide incremental version updates so you can test them as you go (such as using an Agile development process).
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you monitor progress throughout the project to ensure that it's on track?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you pay them? Upfront? Once the project is completed? In stages when they meet specific milestones?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.401Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You should also be very cautious of outsourcing development to India/Bangladesh/etc. The prices will look much cheaper up front, but while I'm sure there are some very good developers out there, you generally get what you pay for. I've seen companies "save" a fortune by outsourcing development to India, and then 12 months down the line having to write off the entire project and start from scratch because what was delivered was fundamentally unfit for purpose. I'm not saying that it can't work out well, but if you're not technical then it's going to be very easy for them to pull the wool over your eyes and BS you.

[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Content: "Hi, I am leading a small team of 4 people and we was developing a small workflow automation tool. Unfortunately our lead developer had to part way from us for certain reasons. Apparently he wanted to begin his venture. It was quite sad for me but I figured that I should respect his decision.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For that reason I am planning to find a new developer. But that COVID-19 situation made me unable to meet new people in person. Then I decided to try hiring freelancers but honestly I am not sure if it would work well.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I used to hire a freelance designer via Fiverr to help designing a logo. But that is too different than hiring a developers. Therefore I would like to ask if there is anyone has hired freelance developer before?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I wish to know where is the good source to find quality developers. And also what should I pay attention to when hiring freelance developers?

[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What others have already said:
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. "Have a look for contributors to GitHub and Stackoverflow. Maybe look for solution to a question you already have solved in your project."
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. "Hiring Development resources is tough, and getting scammed or ripped off is pretty easy on sites such as Fiverr or Upwork.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'd suggest going through an agency and getting a dedicated vetted engineer for your team. Not as cheap, but much higher quality and over site.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Disclaimers: I started 3 startups with that model, and now I run an agency that provides that after seeing how it worked with us. PM me if you need more info."
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. "If you're not technical yourself then it'll be very hard for you to judge the competency of developer, especially if they're not honest with you. The best thing that you can do it to require them to provide references for previous clients who they've done similar work for, and then to speak to those clients about their experience with the developers.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Some questions you can ask to try and identify the difference between proper developers and people who can write code (although be aware that if you don't understand these concept, they can probably just BS you):
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What development methodology do they follow?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do they manage source control?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Do they use tests as part of the development process?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do they backup their code?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What documentation will they provide alongside the code?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What secure development practices do they use?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One of the biggest issues is a mismatch in expectations between the two sides when outsourcing development. Before speaking to them, you need to be clear on:
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What are your functional requirements?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What are your non-functional requirements?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you verify that the developed software meets these requirements?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What is are your deadlines (and are they realistic)?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What is your budget?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What happens if the project goes overbudget or overtime? Are you paying per hour, or a fixed price for the work?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What happens if you make changes to the original design or what additional features added?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Do you require ongoing support, or do they deliver the tool and then you're done?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What about fixing bugs?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Will your receive the source code alongside the working tools? What about documentation, build scripts and instructions, etc?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What level of security do you need for the tool? How will the developers provide this? If it needs third party testing, who will pay?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will the delivery process work? Will you get given the software at the end of the process, or will they provide incremental version updates so you can test them as you go (such as using an Agile development process).
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you monitor progress throughout the project to ensure that it's on track?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you pay them? Upfront? Once the project is completed? In stages when they meet specific milestones?
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You should also be very cautious of outsourcing development to India/Bangladesh/etc. The prices will look much cheaper up front, but while I'm sure there are some very good developers out there, you generally get what you pay for. I've seen companies "save" a fortune by outsourcing development to India, and then 12 months down the line having to write off the entire project and start from scratch because what was delivered was fundamentally unfit for purpose. I'm not saying that it can't work out well, but if you're not technical then it's going to be very easy for them to pull the wool over your eyes and BS you."
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.403Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. "There are a lot of places, ranging from /r/forhire to the tech slacks to the job sites like Indeed. But that's not really the tricky part. I have a company that finds developers for entrepreneurs, including freelance and remote, and it's not so much a matter of where you go to get developers as the kind of scre
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.404Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ening you do. That's basically what I'm getting paid for; although I have some pro places to find developers, really, my value added is that I'm good at telling if a candidate is the right fit. So here's the sort of things you should do:
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.404Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you post a job ad, ask the candidate questions that make it clear whether they actually looked at what the job was. There are freelancers who just respond to every listing out there without even reading them. You don’t want them.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.404Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Be clear about what you want the candidate to do. It's non uncommon for a candidate to accept a job that isn't what they're good at because they misunderstood what the employer was looking for.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.404Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Ask for examples of previous work. Pay attention to the stuff that is as close as possible to what you want them to do.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.404Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * When you look at someone's previous work, focus on the details. How dedicated are they to getting the job done right? A hard worker who follows best practices beats out a sloppy genius.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.404Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don't go for the cheapest guy. There's a reason why he's the cheapest guy. Similarly, if you offer a really low hourly rate, you'll be disappointed by who applies for the opening.
[2025-05-28T21:38:18.404Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Attitude matters. If a candidate is acting like a jerk or being continually late with their responses when they haven't even been hired yet, they're not going to improve once they've gotten the job.
