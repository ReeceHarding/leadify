So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hello,
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My business partner and I are trying to start a software house. We're based in Albania and so far we've only done basic projects or landing pages for locals. The problem here is that the community is not that tech literate so there isn't much demand. Most of our successful competitors usually develop applications for high income countries or are outsourcing from there. This happens because it's a lot cheaper to develop software here and there isn't a considerable drop in quality. However, we're struggling to find international clients for both custom development and outsourcing. Any strategy would be appreciated.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thanks in advance.

[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I was in your shoes once. It took a lot of cold emails and cold calling + attending loads of local networking events with business owners to get my first few clients. You really have to go hard on the customer education.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For example, one of the earlier projects we built was a vehicle rental platform. Typically companies here would dump loads of money into marketing their own shops and go into a price war with their competitors. We approached one of the larger companies, offered to build a fully digital platform for them, and included a way where they can invite their competitors onto the platform AND take a cut from the vehicle rentals.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another project we built was centered around the extra career guidance programmes some companies would run for middle to high school students. Again same deal, we approached one of the bigger firms, pitched to them a web app that allows students to self assess their interests and funnel them into the different career options along with the higher level institutions that offers those courses. We then connected the client to non-public institutions and created a method for them to advertise their certification courses on said platform.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That's ofc amongst just 2 successful stories from hundreds and hundreds of emails, calls and talking to business owners.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Very tough to break in

[2025-05-28T05:54:20.861Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: 1. **Build a Portfolio**: Showcase your work, even personal projects. Offer them as SaaS if possible. This builds credibility and can bring in some initial revenue.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.862Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Content Marketing**: Create and share useful content (blogs, tutorials) to show your expertise. Is the creator era, start show how you do your stuff on TikTok and IG Reel.

[2025-05-28T05:54:20.862Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **How People Give Recommendations**:
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.862Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Recommendations are often presented in a **structured manner**, with numbered lists (as seen in the third and fourth comments) that make them easy to follow. Commenters typically frame their advice based on personal experience, using phrases like "I was in your shoes once" or "this may not float your boat," which adds a personal touch and acknowledges the recipient's perspective. The use of encouraging language, such as "Good luck!" and "hopefully it helps you think of the options," reinforces the supportive tone of the recommendations.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.862Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Overall, the comments reflect
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.863Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: a blend of personal experience, practical advice, and community support, characteristic of many discussions on platforms like Reddit.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.863Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: IMPORTANT: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:

[2025-05-28T05:54:20.863Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Content: "Hello,
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.864Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My business partner and I are trying to start a software house. We're based in Albania and so far we've only done basic projects or landing pages for locals. The problem here is that the community is not that tech literate so there isn't much demand. Most of our successful competitors usually develop applications for high income countries or are outsourcing from there. This happens because it's a lot cheaper to develop software here and there isn't a considerable drop in quality. However, we're struggling to find international clients for both custom development and outsourcing. Any strategy would be appreciated.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.864Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thanks in advance."

[2025-05-28T05:54:20.864Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: "I was in your shoes once. It took a lot of cold emails and cold calling + attending loads of local networking events with business owners to get my first few clients. You really have to go hard on the customer education.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.864Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For example, one of the earlier projects we built was a vehicle rental platform. Typically companies here would dump loads of money into marketing their own shops and go into a price war with their competitors. We approached one of the larger companies, offered to build a fully digital platform for them, and included a way where they can invite their competitors onto the platform AND take a cut from the vehicle rentals.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.864Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another project we built was centered around the extra career guidance programmes some companies would run for middle to high school students. Again same deal, we approached one of the bigger firms, pitched to them a web app that allows students to self assess their interests and funnel them into the different career options along with the higher level institutions that offers those courses. We then connected the client to non-public institutions and created a method for them to advertise their certification courses on said platform.
[2025-05-28T05:54:20.864Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That's ofc amongst just 2 successful stories from hundreds and hundreds of emails, calls and talking to business owners."
