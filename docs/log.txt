[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is casual and conversational. The participants engage in a friendly manner, sharing personal experiences and advice without a formal structure. There is a sense of camaraderie, particularly in the way they offer help and share insights.
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is informal, with the use of slang and abbreviations such as "Saas" (Software as a Service) and "PM" (Product Manager). Phrases like "man" and "just curious" contribute to the conversational feel. The use of direct address (e.g., "you") creates a sense of personal engagement. Hashtags like "#buildinpublic" indicate familiarity with social media culture.
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but generally fall within a medium range. Some are concise, offering brief suggestions or questions, while others provide more detailed advice and personal anecdotes. This variety reflects the nature of online discussions, where participants may choose to elaborate or keep it short based on their thoughts.
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar is mostly casual, with some comments containing incomplete sentences or informal punctuation (e.g., the use of dashes for lists). While the comments are generally understandable, they do not adhere strictly to formal grammar rules. This casual style is typical in online forums where the focus is on quick communication rather than polished writing.

[2025-05-27T18:53:07.089Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient.

[2025-05-27T18:53:07.090Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.090Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T18:53:07.090Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.090Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.090Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.090Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help

[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate ma
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: tch (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)

[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons

[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:53:07.091Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers).

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:53:24.047Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I’m a recent graduate however I took a year and off due to personal reasons so have a really big gap in my resume. I also spent the last few months relearning a lot of things I forgot. I recently just was offered a contract to hire and accepted it as the company is really well known and would be a really good opportunity and also something to put on my resume. However, the contract for hire isn’t from the company itself instead it’s from a company that finds role for the hiring company. The position is for a junior software developer position and the contract is for 6 months and has an ending date. My question is since it’s a contract to hire for a junior developer position which I heard takes time to train junior developers, is likely that if I perform well that I will be hired by the hiring company at the end of the contract? I heard a lot of companies just use contract to hire to just keep you contracted so was wondering if this scenario is one of them.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.047Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.047Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: Can’t really say without more information, but usually a contracting company hires you as full time employee and that company contracts you out to another firm for 6 months.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.047Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you don’t have to file your own contracting forms along with tax associated requirements then this is most likely the case.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.047Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Whether you could get converted or not depends on the contract. Read it carefully to see if there is a clause in there that allows this process
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.047Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Most contract jobs are potential "contract to hire" jobs.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Either company can give full time offer.  The client company may need to fill the role permanently and give offer.  The contract company can assess that they can easily place people at other projects and want to lock people down.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Many people do contract for other reasons.  Plenty of people turn down full time offers.  They want flexibility of working for few months and go do something else rest of the year.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: \> is likely that if I perform well that I will be hired by the hiring company at the end of the contract?
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That's how contract-to-hire is expected to work.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There's no guarantee of course. There are parts that you can control, such as the quality of the work you do. There are parts you can't control, such as the work they give you, and way their business runs. At the end of your contract, two things need to be true:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. You need to have demonstrated that you'd be a valuable long-term hire.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. The company needs to have resources and available work for a long-term hire.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You control most (but not all) of #1 and you don't control #2 at all.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Sometimes companies embark on contract-to-hire agreements without knowing for sure that they'll even be able to hire at the end. It's a hedged bet of sorts.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.048Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I don't know the numbers industry-wide. But most contract-to-hire people I've known have gotten offers.

[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")

[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing

[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: What’s a contract to hire like?
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: I’m a recent graduate however I took a year and off due to personal reasons so have a really big gap in my resume. I also spent the last few months relearning a lot of things I forgot. I recently just was offered a contract to hire and accepted it as the company is really well known and would be a really good opportunity and also something to put on my resume. However, the contract for hire isn’t from the company itself instead it’s from a company that finds role for the hiring company. The position is for a junior software developer position and the contract is for 6 months and has an ending date. My question is since it’s a contract to hire for a junior developer position which I heard takes time to train junior developers, is likely that if I perform well that I will be hired by the hiring company at the end of the contract? I heard a lot of companies just use contract to hire to just keep you contracted so was wondering if this scenario is one of them.

[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Can’t really say without more information, but usually a contracting company hires you as full time employee and that company contracts you out to another firm for 6 months.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you don’t have to file your own contracting forms along with tax associated requirements then this is most likely the case.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Whether you could get converted or not depends on the contract. Read it carefully to see if there is a clause in there that allows this process
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most contract jobs are potential "contract to hire" jobs.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Either company can give full time offer.  The client company may need to fill the role permanently and give offer.  The contract company can assess that they can easily place people at other projects and want to lock people down.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Many people do contract for other reasons.  Plenty of people turn down full time offers.  They want flexibility of working for few months and go do something else rest of the year.

[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: \> is likely that if I perform well that I will be hired by the hiring company at the end of the contract?
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That's how contract-to-hire is expected to work.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There's no guarantee of course. There are parts that you can control, such as the quality of the work you do. There are parts you can't control, such as the work they give you, and way their business runs. At the end of your contract, two things need to be true:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. You need to have demonstrated that you'd be a valuable long-term hire.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.049Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. The company needs to have resources and available work for a long-term hire.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You control most (but not all) of #1 and you don't control #2 at all.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Sometimes companies embark on contract-to-hire agreements without knowing for sure that they'll even be able to hire at the end. It's a hedged bet of sorts.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I don't know the numbers industry-wide. But most contract-to-hire people I've known have gotten offers.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.050Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.051Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.051Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.051Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.051Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:53:24.051Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T18:53:33.952Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, with a mix of **supportive and advisory** elements. Many commenters express a willingness to help and share their expertise, which adds a friendly and encouraging vibe. However, there are also cautionary notes, particularly regarding hiring practices, which lend a serious undertone to some comments.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.952Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.952Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is generally straightforward, with some technical jargon related to software development and project management. There are instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "PM" for project management), and terms like "devops," "QA," and "CTO" are common. The use of phrases like "you may want to" and "it depends" indicates a thoughtful approach to advice, while exclamatory phrases (e.g., "I would *love* to chat about this!") convey enthusiasm.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.952Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.952Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary significantly in length, with some being quite brief (one or two sentences) while others are more extensive, providing detailed advice and considerations. The longer comments often break down different options (like hiring practices) into sections (A, B, C), indicating a structured approach to conveying information.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.953Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.953Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is predominantly **casual**, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or informal phrasing. However, many comments maintain

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:53:33.955Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: 1. It depends on the size of the projects, timelines, budget and expected quality (keeping in mind not all large firms produce timely (nor sometimes quality) code/software.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.955Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Software developer is a broad term, so you’d likely (partly to ensure quality, partly to find the right people generally) need to search for the programming language expected, or someone with experience making similar products. The former of these is harder if you’re not a software developer, but it’s often good to look around at existing similar systems and understand what languages they use, pros and cons, and go from there, but this approach isn’t entirely necessary, it depends on how much time/interest you have!

The use of phrases like "you may want to" and "it depends" indicates a thoughtful approach to advice, while exclamatory phrases (e.g., "I would *love* to chat about this!") convey enthusiasm.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary significantly in length, with some being quite brief (one or two sentences) while others are more extensive, providing detailed advice and considerations. The longer comments often break down different options (like hiring practices) into sections (A, B, C), indicating a structured approach to conveying information.

[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)

[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")

[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== USER PROMPT ==========
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: How to hire someone to build company software?
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: My employer is tasking me with looking into and ultimately employing someone to build company specific software for our different departments. The sector we work in is Medical Staffing (so think recruiting, scheduling, finance).
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am not well versed in this field, so any help to the following would be amazing.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Wouldn’t the nature of such request be better suited for a company with a development team and not necessarily an individual?
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. What is the job title I should be researching? Software developer, programmer, etc?
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is the start of the journey for us, we are a small business. I understand this may seem naive but every company has to start somewhere, so I’m trying to gain as much helpful information and resources possible so that I can help guide us properly.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thank you!

[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Don't, it will not work out. Get something off the shelf. Unless you have six digit budget and few years to complete.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. It depends on the size of the projects, timelines, budget and expected quality (keeping in mind not all large firms produce timely (nor sometimes quality) code/software.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Software developer is a broad term, so you’d likely (partly to ensure quality, partly to find the right people generally) need to search for the programming language expected, or someone with experience making similar products. The former of these is harder if you’re not a software developer, but it’s often good to look around at existing similar systems and understand what languages they use, pros and cons, and go from there, but this approach isn’t entirely necessary, it depends on how much time/interest you have!
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: How did it go? Very curious to see how things went since it's been a year!
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would *love* to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a handful of things you need to consider: how involved do you want to be? How much $ do you want to invest? What is your tolerance for risk? And, where is your expertise? Then you have a few options.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A: offshore team or staff augmentation:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you know exactly what you want to have done and you can build a roadmap, hold a team accountable to their deliverables, sense BS in a technical setting, then this is a good option. You can save money going this route if you have a somewhat time-boxed project, but you need strong management and very strong communication and
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: product direction. This may be less expensive but it costs your time and you need to know what you want.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: B. Hire an engineer:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It sounds like you would need to hire a Jack-of-all-trades full stack developer, and an employee of course needs management support and resources to thrive in their role. Look for someone who has experience in a few different tech stacks and languages. Expect to pay a relatively high salary for someone with experience in architecture design, team leadership, devops and systems integration. I love these people but they can be difficult to find. Lots of engineers _think_ they are like this, but it’s a special person who can fill the role of the first/only software developer at a growing company in a competitive field. This is a great longer term choice that produces good quality custom work if you find the right fit, but you need solid management and goals in place or this will frustrate you very much. You’ll also need to hire more engineers down the road, need a plan for software testing, build tech policies, all that.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: C. Hire a 3rd party company.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Search for “digital innovation” or “custom software” or look at “beaugmented.ai” and ask to set up an intro call. These firms can build a team of the right types of engineers, developers, managers, qa, product people and designers that fits your needs and stays in your budget. They will work with you to define exactly what you want and tell you what to expect in terms of timelines and roadmaps, they should be able to help you get to a small, working project and grow from there as your company grows. They will care about making you money because they should understand your business needs. This may be an expensive option upfront but it will get you to your goal faster and much better, especially if you don’t have a cto or technical team in-house. Unless you plan to build out a whole software team internally (at least 4 people) then this is usually the best way.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Again, I’d love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!

[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You...may want to employ a company that makes line of business software.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It depends on how complex your needs are.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would recommend against just hiring a solitary programmer and expecting the moon. First, likely the programmer has gaps in their knowledge. If not, they are likely either very expensive or very inexperienced (and faking it). Finally, having someone test their own work is bad practice.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention

[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:53:33.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:53:51.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (cl
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: early expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:53:51.081Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T18:54:06.454Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.454Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. While some comments contain technical information, they are presented in a friendly and approachable manner. There are elements of humor, particularly in the first few comments, which adds to the casual vibe. The tone is also supportive, with users offering advice and sharing personal experiences.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.454Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.454Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language patterns include a mix of **technical jargon** related to hiring and taxation (e.g., "B2B," "invoices," "contractors"), as well as **everyday language** that makes the comments accessible to a broader audience. There is minimal use of slang, but some abbreviations (like "EoR" for Employer of Record) are present. Emojis and informal expressions (like "You're welcome" and "Good luck") contribute to the casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.454Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with some being very brief (a few words) while others are more detailed, providing comprehensive answers or explanations. The average length seems to be a few sentences to a paragraph, allowing for concise yet informative responses.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is predominantly **casual**. While most comments are coherent and well-structured, there are instances of informal phrasing and sentence fragments. Some comments contain minor grammatical errors or omissions, reflecting a conversational style

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:54:06.458Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hey everyone,
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.458Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am a US client of a large software development firm with the team spread across Europe. I love my dev team, but I’m not happy with the dev house. Recently they announced that they’re going to shift all devs to Asia. This would be a huge setback for me because I will lose all of the experience and knowledge share we’ve built. Also, many of our team are from Ukraine and Belarus, so when they get fired they will lose their visa status within 6 months.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.458Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So, I want to fire the dev house and hire the team, but I can’t do this directly because of some contractual clauses that prevent it. My plan is to create a new company to hire the team, but I don’t really know the norms of software devs in Europe. I’ve also never navigated EU taxes, employee benefits/entitlements before, etc.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.458Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Would you prefer to be contracted out by a dev house or work directly with a client?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.458Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Would you prefer to work directly for the company or as a contractor?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do you typically get paid hourly or a salary?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What are some things I should expect hiring remote devs in the EU?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: At the end of the day I want to do what’s right for my team. Thanks for your insight!

[2025-05-27T18:54:06.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: For example, in Poland, programmers can easily work as B2B directly, and they will send you the invoices you need to pay. All taxes (12% + social insurance) are dealt with by themselves, but programmers used to have medical insurance from the client as well as benefit
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also, you can open a company there and continue to work as B2B, but via the local company + possibility of working contract, but it requires more taxes
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also, there are a lot of programmers from Ukraine or Belarus in Poland as well (I'm one of them). Also, Ukrainians don't need visas now

Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient.

[2025-05-27T18:54:06.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Campaign Focus Keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Community Tone Analysis:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. While some comments contain technical information, they are presented in a friendly and approachable manner. There are elements of humor, particularly in the first few comments, which adds to the casual vibe. The tone is also supportive, with users offering advice and sharing personal experiences.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language patterns include a mix of **technical jargon** related to hiring and taxation (e.g., "B2B," "invoices," "contractors"), as well as **everyday language** that makes the comments accessible to a broader audience. There is minimal use of slang, but some abbreviations (like "EoR" for Employer of Record) are present. Emojis and informal expressions (like "You're welcome" and "Good luck") contribute to the casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with some being very brief (a few words) while others are more detailed, providing comprehensive answers or explanations. The average length seems to be a few sentences to a paragraph, allowing for concise yet informative responses.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is predominantly **casual**. While most comments are coherent and well-structured, there are instances of informal phrasing and sentence fragments. Some comments contain minor grammatical errors or omissions, reflecting a conversational style
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing

[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: How do I hire and pay EU developers?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Hey everyone,
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am a US client of a large software development firm with the team spread across Europe. I love my dev team, but I’m not happy with the dev house. Recently they announced that they’re going to shift all devs to Asia. This would be a huge setback for me because I will lose all of the experience and knowledge share we’ve built. Also, many of our team are from Ukraine and Belarus, so when they get fired they will lose their visa status within 6 months.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So, I want to fire the dev house and hire the team, but I can’t do this directly because of some contractual clauses that prevent it. My plan is to create a new company to hire the team, but I don’t really know the norms of software devs in Europe. I’ve also never navigated EU taxes, employee benefits/entitlements before, etc.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Would you prefer to be contracted out by a dev house or work directly with a client?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Would you prefer to work directly for the company or as a contractor?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do you typically get paid hourly or a salary?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What are some things I should expect hiring remote devs in the EU?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: At the end of the day I want to do what’s right for my team. Thanks for your insight!

[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > What are some things I should expect hiring remote devs in the EU?
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: a lot of applications
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Start by hiring me.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You're welcome.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For example, in Poland, programmers can easily work as B2B directly, and they will send you the invoices you need to pay. All taxes (12% + social insurance) are dealt with by themselves, but programmers used to have medical insurance from the client as well as benefit
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also, you can open a company there and continue to work as B2B, but via the local company + possibility of working contract, but it requires more taxes
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also, there are a lot of programmers from Ukraine or Belarus in Poland as well (I'm one of them). Also, Ukrainians don't need visas now
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Good luck
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---

[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: `Would you prefer to be contracted out by a dev house or work directly with a client?`
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Directly with the client.**
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: `Would you prefer to work directly for the company or as a contractor?`
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Directly. But it depends on the country. Poland, for example, has low taxes for b2b. My country doesn't have that low taxes for b2b so I prefer to be hired directly.**
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: `Do you typically get paid hourly or a salary?`
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Salary. I am hired directly to my employer thou

[2025-05-27T18:54:06.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What stack are you looking for? I might be one of your candidates :D
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In my experience, working directly with clients fosters a more genuine connection, crucial for long-term relationships. It also eliminates intermediaries, allowing for more efficient financial allocation for both parties.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:54:06.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I already have full time work as a Senior Software Engineer and have over 10 YOE. I’d like to make some extra money, but really want to press my skills and develop other skills.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Right now my resume is a Rails specialist, but I’m interested in other technologies. Absolutely loved working with elixir on the Phoenix stack but I’m really open to lots of things.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I contracted full time for five years in the past but only full time contracts.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I understand that it will take time and money to develop a reputation on whichever community / communities that I choose. That doesn’t bother me, but it is a big reason why I don’t just try a bunch all at once. I want to be strategic.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I’ve considered things like Upwork, Thumbtack and Toptal, but I’m really having trouble deciding and don’t really feel like I am necessarily looking at all of the right options. Also, I’ll be looking to charge about $100 an hour or so, so sites that cater to people looking to find the cheapest contractors won’t work for me. Also, I don’t really want to just hack crap together with clients that don’t care about anything but initial investment including reliability, extensibility and maintenance.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Side note: I tried to find the most appropriate subreddit in which to post, but I’m a novice when it comes to posting. I mostly just comment right now. Took a swing anyways!
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I did contract work for the first 8 years of my career. As with everything, there are a lot of ways to skin a cat. I can offer my perspective having had a good amount of success contracting in SF.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My first thought is:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Companies prefer full-time contractors over part-time
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Companies prefer domain experts
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Most contract work is not on sexy new stacks like Elixir on the Phoenix
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I think you're definitely putting yourself in a challenging position.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > Upwork, Thumbtack and Toptal
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Those sites are not for serious professionals. Companies with the budget and skill to build something worthwhile are not finding contractors on Upwork.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > I’ll be looking to charge about $100 an hour
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The good news is that's cheap. You could reach out to consulting firms, agencies, and recruiters / staffing agencies, and tell them you want $100/hr and a lot of them can make that happen. My advice would be to start there. The other place to look is within your network.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The last thing I'd say is that juggling two jobs at once is not something I'd recommend. I wouldn't even do two contracts at once when I was contracting. Inevitably, their deadlines land the same day or week. It's never like one needs you 40 hours this week and the other needs you 40 the next. Or they both need 20 every week and it's ok if you leave things half finished. What will happen is both will have work come in ebbs and flows and they'll coincide often enough that you need to be prepared to work 80+ hour weeks to keep everyone happy.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This comes back to my first point that people don't want part-time help. It's going to be very hard to make meaningful progress working nights and weekends. I generally think your time is better spent getting better at your day job, getting promotions, and job hopping to better companies.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > I tried to find the most appropriate subreddit in which to post
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: /r/freelance exists. There's no good subreddit for this topic though. The problem is, every subreddit is 95% people with a tenuous grasp of the topic who drown out the 5% who are talking sense.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: The best clients will come from your personal network, so start there.  If not, you may have luck with a body shop like toptal, they definitely have 5-10h/week engagements
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Last time I got into a thread around this, I got a lot of downvotes for saying that a programmer could provide value to a business without being full time.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That said, I recommend networking as your primary marketing avenue.  Go to local user groups--or start one.  Go to your local chamber of commerce.  Go to conferences.  Offer to give presentations.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.846Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I had no luck with sites like upwork; as I cannot compete with oversees worker who are happy to make my hourly rate in a month.  (<-- in fairness, I haven't tried these types of sites in a very long time).

[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I’ve considered things like Upwork, Thumbtack and Toptal, but I’m really having trouble deciding and don’t really feel like I am necessarily looking at all of the right options. Also, I’ll be looking to charge about $100 an hour or so, so sites that cater to people looking to find the cheapest contractors won’t work for me. Also, I don’t really want to just hack crap together with clients that don’t care about anything but initial investment including reliability, extensibility and maintenance.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Side note: I tried to find the most appropriate subreddit in which to post, but I’m a novice when it comes to posting. I mostly just comment right now. Took a swing anyways!

[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I did contract work for the first 8 years of my career. As with everything, there are a lot of ways to skin a cat. I can offer my perspective having had a good amount of success contracting in SF.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My first thought is:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Companies prefer full-time contractors over part-time
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Companies prefer domain experts
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Most contract work is not on sexy new stacks like Elixir on the Phoenix
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I think you're definitely putting yourself in a challenging position.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > Upwork, Thumbtack and Toptal
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Those sites are not for serious professionals. Companies with the budget and skill to build something worthwhile are not finding contractors on Upwork.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > I’ll be looking to charge about $100 an hour
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The good news is that's cheap. You could reach out to consulting firms, agencies, and recruiters / staffing agencies, and tell them you want $100/hr and a lot of them can make that happen. My advice would be to start there. The other place to look is within your network.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The last thing I'd say is that juggling two jobs at once is not something I'd recommend. I wouldn't even do two contracts at once when I was contracting. Inevitably, their deadlines land the same day or week. It's never like one needs you 40 hours this week and the other needs you 40 the next. Or they both need 20 every week and it's ok if you leave things half finished. What will happen is both will have work come in ebbs and flows and they'll coincide often enough that you need to be prepared to work 80+ hour weeks to keep everyone happy.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This comes back to my first point that people don't want part-time help. It's going to be very hard to make meaningful progress working nights and weekends. I generally think your time is better spent getting better at your day job, getting promotions, and job hopping to better companies.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > I tried to find the most appropriate subreddit in which to post
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: /r/freelance exists. There's no good subreddit for this topic though. The problem is, every subreddit is 95% people with a tenuous grasp of the topic who drown out the 5% who are talking sense.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The best clients will come from your personal network, so start there.  If not, you may have luck with a body shop like toptal, they definitely have 5-10h/week engagements
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Last time I got into a thread around this, I got a lot of downvotes for saying that a programmer could provide value to a business without being full time.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That said, I recommend networking as your primary marketing avenue.  Go to local user groups--or start one.  Go to your local chamber of commerce.  Go to conferences.  Offer to give presentations.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I had no luck with sites like upwork; as I cannot compete with oversees worker who are happy to make my hourly rate in a month.  (<-- in fairness, I haven't tried these types of sites in a very long time).

[2025-05-27T18:54:21.848Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hey OP, a fellow SWE with 5 YoE here that considers starting a contract job as well. Did you manage to get some and how did you do it? I've technically never done any contract jobs and have no clue where to start..
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.849Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal to
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ols, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.850Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:54:21.851Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T18:54:34.560Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.560Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is casual and conversational. Participants share personal experiences and insights in a straightforward manner, often using first-person narratives. There is a mix of cautionary advice and practical tips, reflecting a blend of skepticism and realism about contract-to-hire positions.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.560Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.560Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is informal, with the use of colloquial expressions and phrases such as "worked out well-ish," "jump through extra hoops," and "carrot on a stick." There is also a tendency to use abbreviations like "C2H" for contract-to-hire, and acronyms like "FTE" for full-time employee. Some comments include direct addresses to the audience (e.g., "you should treat the 6 month contract as an extended interview"), which adds to the conversational nature.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.560Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.560Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but generally tend to be medium to long. Many comments provide detailed personal anecdotes or multiple points of advice, indicating a willingness to elaborate on experiences rather than just offering brief responses.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.561Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.561Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar is mostly casual and conversational, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or informal punctuation (e.g., ellipses, dashes). While there are instances of well-structured sentences, the overall style leans towards a relaxed, informal approach rather than strict grammatical precision.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for.

[2025-05-27T18:54:34.562Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hi all, let me give some background. I graduated last year with a degree in MIS. I am currently in position of scrum master in a moderate CoL area making 63k, with the company for 9 months. I've expressed interest in trying out a developer position and I am scheduled to have a technical development interview next week to try my hand at development.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.562Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However last week I was contacted by a recruiter for a scrum master position in my dream city (lower CoL than current), and the hourly salary would be equivalent to 1.6x my current salary. But as the title suggests, it is a 6month contract to hire position. The company is also in (what seems to me), a very niche industry that's in past few years begun ramping up their tech areas.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Basically what I'm looking for input on is:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Have you done a contract to hire position? Did it work out? What are risks?
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * So far I don't mind being a scrum master, but it's not the most exciting work (at least within current company). My current company really likes me and knows I want to try out development so they're trying to put me in a developer rotation program (given I pass their interview).
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thanks!
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I've done two 6-month contract-to-hire positions. One worked out well-ish and one didn't.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The one that didn't work out: they kept pushing back my hire date. I worked there for 18 months on contract with no benefits. My manager really liked me, but couldn't get the approval from Finance to pull the trigger. There was also some awkwardness with contract-to-hire employees not being treated as well as full-time employees, like being excluded from company events and needing to jump through extra hoops for office supplies. That sounds kind of petty, but it's draining when you're not treated like you're part of the team.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The one that did work out, mostly: I got hired after the 6-month mark, although the initial agreement was for a 20% raise when I switched to full time (which I stupidly did not get in writing). They brought me on at a 5% raise instead. I pushed them to give my annual performance review 6 months "early" to make up for that somewhat (1 year after original start date, rather than 1 year after full-time hire date). I still ended up below market rate, though.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I wouldn't recommend contract to hire personally even if the company is one that you want to work for.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. I've heard managers say that they have no intention of hiring the person for the intended position ever. The manager looks at it as cheap, easy to get rid of labor. Rather than a long term interview/trial period. Many of these positions were intended for short sprints or just pure content development that they didn't need SWE/FTE for.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. The benefits suck and I've never heard of anyone getting their initial targetted salary. Normally it's much less if there is ever an offer. I never heard of a contract to hire position that pays relocation, full time positions normally will pay for it with a 1 year commitment.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. Generally speaking you're never going to be able to negotiate the benefits lost completely by being a full time employee add in at least 30% market value for your area to what is a full time engineer and all you'll hear is crickets. (If you are already currently market value and they are offering the 60% increase go for it)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. These recruiters will say whatever to make you think it's different and that it's just a policy that the company uses when hiring.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Contract to hire is very predatory in nature from what I've heard of and experienced think of it being like a carrot on a stick and never being able to get the carrot.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: If you can confirm with the client themselves that they are looking to bring the contractors on, I would go for it. Just keep in mind, for the 6 months as a contractor you really will not get much for benefits. Horrible insurance, and no days off/sick days. Other than that, just do your best during the 6 months and get noticed.

[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Community Tone Analysis:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is casual and conversational. Participants share personal experiences and insights in a straightforward manner, often using first-person narratives. There is a mix of cautionary advice and practical tips, reflecting a blend of skepticism and realism about contract-to-hire positions.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is informal, with the use of colloquial expressions and phrases such as "worked out well-ish," "jump through extra hoops," and "carrot on a stick." There is also a tendency to use abbreviations like "C2H" for contract-to-hire, and acronyms like "FTE" for full-time employee. Some comments include direct addresses to the audience (e.g., "you should treat the 6 month contract as an extended interview"), which adds to the conversational nature.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but generally tend to be medium to long. Many comments provide detailed personal anecdotes or multiple points of advice, indicating a willingness to elaborate on experiences rather than just offering brief responses.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar is mostly casual and conversational, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or informal punctuation (e.g., ellipses, dashes). While there are instances of well-structured sentences, the overall style leans towards a relaxed, informal approach rather than strict grammatical precision.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.565Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== USER PROMPT ==========
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Opinion on Contract to Hire?
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Hi all, let me give some background. I graduated last year with a degree in MIS. I am currently in position of scrum master in a moderate CoL area making 63k, with the company for 9 months. I've expressed interest in trying out a developer position and I am scheduled to have a technical development interview next week to try my hand at development.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However last week I was contacted by a recruiter for a scrum master position in my dream city (lower CoL than current), and the hourly salary would be equivalent to 1.6x my current salary. But as the title suggests, it is a 6month contract to hire position. The company is also in (what seems to me), a very niche industry that's in past few years begun ramping up their tech areas.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Basically what I'm looking for input on is:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Have you done a contract to hire position? Did it work out? What are risks?
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * So far I don't mind being a scrum master, but it's not the most exciting work (at least within current company). My current company really likes me and knows I want to try out development so they're trying to put me in a developer rotation program (given I pass their interview).
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thanks!
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/cscareerquestions
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I've done two 6-month contract-to-hire positions. One worked out well-ish and one didn't.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The one that didn't work out: they kept pushing back my hire date. I worked there for 18 months on contract with no benefits. My manager really liked me, but couldn't get the approval from Finance to pull the trigger. There was also some awkwardness with contract-to-hire employees not being treated as well as full-time employees, like being excluded from company events and needing to jump through extra hoops for office supplies. That sounds kind of petty, but it's draining when you're not treated like you're part of the team.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The one that did work out, mostly: I got hired after the 6-month mark, although the initial agreement was for a 20% raise when I switched to full time (which I stupidly did not get in writing). They brought me on at a 5% raise instead. I pushed them to give my annual performance review 6 months "early" to make up for that somewhat (1 year after original start date, rather than 1 year after full-time hire date). I still ended up below market rate, though.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I wouldn't recommend contract to hire personally even if the company is one that you want to work for.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. I've heard managers say that they have no intention of hiring the person for the intended position ever. The manager looks at it as cheap, easy to get rid of labor. Rather than a long term interview/trial period. Many of these positions were intended for short sprints or just pure content development that they didn't need SWE/FTE for.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. The benefits suck and I've never heard of anyone getting their initial targetted salary. Normally it's much less if there is ever an offer. I never heard of a contract to hire position that pays relocation, full time positions normally will pay for it with a 1 year commitment.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. Generally speaking you're never going to be able to negotiate the benefits lost completely by being a full time employee add in at least 30% market value for your area to what is a full time engineer and all you'll hear is crickets. (If you are already currently market value and they are offering the 60% increase go for it)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. These recruiters will say whatever to make you think it's different and that it's just a policy that the company uses when hiring.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Contract to hire is very predatory in nature from what I've heard of and experienced think of it being like a carrot on a stick and never being able to get the carrot.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you can confirm with the client themselves that they are looking to bring the contractors on, I would go for it. Just keep in mind, for the 6 months as a contractor you really will not get much for benefits. Horrible insurance, and no days off/sick days. Other than that, just do your best during the 6 months and get noticed.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I've exclusively done C2H.  In my city (Pittsburgh), it seems like the only way to go if you're looking for work through recruiters.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In both cases it's gone really well.  My hourly pay was much higher than my then-current salary, with the expectation that my salary upon hire would be lower, but I would have benefits.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However, in both cases I managed to prove myself enough in those 6 months to get a higher "starting" salary.  In one case, my salary ended up being equal to my contractor rate (and I got benefits).  In the other case, I got an extra ~1%, but the expectations for me were much higher.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It could take a while to become a FTE if that’s your goal. At my company it takes around 2-3 years for this. Also you need to negotiate your salary to make up for lack of benefits, bonuses, insurances, sick days, vacation days, etc...
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:54:34.569Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:54:44.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I just quit my FAANG job after 4.5 years. I hate the 9-5 grind and I'm not financially motivated. My dream life is working a few months a year to cover expenses and spending the rest of my time surfing in low cost places. Programming is a means to an end for me. I have no interest in grinding for a million years on LeetCode to get a job I don't really want in the first place.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What is the interview process like for contractors? Do you have to do dumb technical interviews for every contract? How long is a typical contract? Do you need to work with an agency/does it make the interview process easier? Not looking to maximize income, just looking for an easy way to work with a short term commitment.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thanks :)

[2025-05-27T18:54:44.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I'm a contractor (EU, 20y XP). Have been for a little over 3 years now. I basically just quit my job and started looking for contract. It helps to have a ton of experience in an in-demand skillset :)
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > What is the interview process like for contractors? Do you have to do dumb technical interviews for every contract?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In general they're easier because they can easily get rid of you. Especially here in the EU they can basically cancel at any time. Contrary to internal employees that, when tenured, are expensive to get rid of.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.455Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > How long is a typical contract?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In my case the contracts are often 3-6 months, but they generally get renewed more or less automatically. My first contract was 2 years, the second was 1 year (but they wanted me to stay longer, I just wasn't interested), current one looks to be 1 year as well.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > Do you need to work with an agency/does it make the interview process easier?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a lot of recruiters active in this space. I generally try to avoid them because they want to put an extra rate (10-20%) on top of yours for 'finding' work for you, without doing much for you at all. So it really depends on how strong your network was. My first and current projects were direct, the second one was through a recruter that added 10 euro's an hour to my rate.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > just looking for an easy way to work
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Finding work as a contract is not easier than finding work as an employee. Just FYI. Sure the interviews are easier, but there is a lot of competition of bad developers wanting easy interviews and a lot more money. So it's important you're able to stand out.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: There are different types of contracting work, so be aware that you’ll get different responses from different people.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Perhaps the most common type is similar to employment in many ways, except you’re designated as a contractor and the job is time-limited. These are often 6-12 months to start with an expectation of renewal. You’ll also go through an interview process, although maybe not quite as strict. These can often be found through recruiters and job boards. In many ways, it’s like any other full-time job but with some minor status differences and the expiration date.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The second type is more like consulting. If you have special expertise in an area, you can pitch yourself to companies to come in for a few weeks to a few months and accomplish some very specific tasks or maybe train the team on some specialty. This type often requires more of a reputation and sales skills to pitch your way into these companies. You won’t find these roles through recruiters, but you can create them by selling yourself and working your network. If you don’t like selling, you won’t like this.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The first type of contracting isn’t going to fit your dream of working a couple months per year and then vacationing for the rest of it. Most companies don’t want to invest all of the effort into getting someone onboarded just for them to leave in a few weeks.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The second type might fit your ideal, but it’s going to be nearly impossible to build the reputation and network you need to make it sustainable if you’re only working a couple months every year. Your skills will likely fall behind if you’re literally working 10-20% as often as everyone else, which isn’t a recipe for becoming and staying an expert in the way that you’d need to be for this to work.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Honestly I’m not convinced that contracting is the magic bullet to solve your aversion to the 9-5 like you think it is. It tends to either be like a full-time job or a lot of work for short-term contracts. IMO, what you really need is to find a sustainable job that you actually like and embrace that. Take vacations and plan for early retirement. Take a sabbatical if you must. But the idea of working a couple months per year to live cheaply somewhere is more fantasy than reality for most.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: > What is the interview process like for contractors?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Very similar to interviews for permanent roles, just usually with lower expectations.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > Do you have to do dumb technical interviews for every contract?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.457Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: They do “traditional” tech assessments less frequently but you will still run into them.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.457Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > How long is a typical contract?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.457Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There’s a huge range. 3 months is the shortest I’ve seen, 6, 12, and 18 month are very common. There are some indefinite contracts out there as well, but I haven’t seen those nearly as often.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.457Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > Do you need to work with an agency/does it make the interview process easier?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.457Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You don’t have to but I think there’s some value in considering it. Agencies sometimes get access to roles before they’re made public, and they can provide detailed interview prep, which I’ve found very helpful in the past. I think that an agency vouching for you has some weight as well. Also, not having to think about taxes is nice — during 2020 I did a 6mo contract as an independent contractor and my owed taxes were obscenely high.

[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > What is the interview process like for contractors? Do you have to do dumb technical interviews for every contract?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In general they're easier because they can easily get rid of you. Especially here in the EU they can basically cancel at any time. Contrary to internal employees that, when tenured, are expensive to get rid of.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > How long is a typical contract?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In my case the contracts are often 3-6 months, but they generally get renewed more or less automatically. My first contract was 2 years, the second was 1 year (but they wanted me to stay longer, I just wasn't interested), current one looks to be 1 year as well.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > Do you need to work with an agency/does it make the interview process easier?
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a lot of recruiters active in this space. I generally try to avoid them because they want to put an extra rate (10-20%) on top of yours for 'finding' work for you, without doing much for you at all. So it really depends on how strong your network was. My first and current projects were direct, the second one was through a recruter that added 10 euro's an hour to my rate.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > just looking for an easy way to work
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Finding work as a contract is not easier than finding work as an employee. Just FYI. Sure the interviews are easier, but there is a lot of competition of bad developers wanting easy interviews and a lot more money. So it's important you're able to stand out.

[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are different types of contracting work, so be aware that you’ll get different responses from different people.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Perhaps the most common type is similar to employment in many ways, except you’re designated as a contractor and the job is time-limited. These are often 6-12 months to start with an expectation of renewal. You’ll also go through an interview process, although maybe not quite as strict. These can often be found through recruiters and job boards. In many ways, it’s like any other full-time job but with some minor status differences and the expiration date.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The second type is more like consulting.

The pay was moderate above regular work, but a good deal below FAANG et all when you factor TC.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The good was lots of time off, very relaxed pace, the bad was it was very isolating; i think this would be true for most contract work.

[2025-05-27T18:54:44.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am in the exact same position as your (almost so much that I thought did I post this post :) ). These are the things I wanted and I am in the USA. I wanted to work maybe 10 - 20 hour/week and earn something like $30 - 50k / annum, which would roughly translate to about $50/hr if possible in an area I am interested in. I tried the following:

[2025-05-27T18:54:44.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. Finding fully remote full time jobs but with the stipulation that I will decide on my own work schedule(40 hr/week)
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. Finding fully remote contract work (40 hr/week).
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Out of these I found 1 to be more difficult and 2 to be practically impossible. 3 is more easier but it is difficult to explain to recruiters what I mean by flexitime. 4 is the easiest and will probably land a contract job  in the next couple of weeks. This is not exactly what I wanted to do since I don't need to work 40 hrs/week.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However, I plan to keep searching and building my network till I achieve my goals. One of the things I thought was maybe I can do a contract for 3-6 months and then take off for the rest of the year and then search again, but that might lead to big gaps in my resume making me unemployable for the rest of my career.

[2025-05-27T18:54:44.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)

[2025-05-27T18:54:44.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:54:44.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.

Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T18:54:59.795Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.796Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.796Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **candid and critical**, with a mix of **informal and conversational** elements. Commenters express skepticism about the job offer and the nature of contracting work at Amazon, often using a straightforward and sometimes blunt approach. There is an undercurrent of **concern for the individual's well-being**, particularly regarding work-life balance (WLB) and job security.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.796Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.796Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "CRUD developer," "WLB," "PTO") and **casual language**. Some comments include **slang** (e.g., "glutton for punishment," "getting raped" in a metaphorical sense) and **abbreviations** (e.g., "PTO" for paid time off, "W2" vs. "1099" contracts). There is also a tendency to use **hyperbolic expressions** to emphasize points, such as "horrible offer" or "one of the worst wlb areas."
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.796Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.796Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length but tend to be **moderately detailed**, often consisting of several sentences to a few paragraphs. Some comments provide in-depth analysis and personal anecdotes, while others are shorter and more direct. This reflects a balance between providing thorough insights and maintaining engagement in a forum setting.

[2025-05-27T18:54:59.797Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

Some comments include **slang** (e.g., "glutton for punishment," "getting raped" in a metaphorical sense) and **abbreviations** (e.g., "PTO" for paid time off, "W2" vs. "1099" contracts). There is also a tendency to use **hyperbolic expressions** to emphasize points, such as "horrible offer" or "one of the worst wlb areas."

[2025-05-27T18:54:59.797Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hey guys, I'm an embedded software developer with 3+ YOE on the east coast, USA. I currently work in the defense industry and have been looking to move to the west coast in California. I've been interviewing for jobs the past few months, but recently was contacted by Actalent for a SW position with Amazon project Kuiper (LA, California).
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.797Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I had a brief call with the Actalent recruiter, followed by a teams call with an Amazon Software Engineer (45 min). It was a great discussion, the work sounded awesome, and we finished with a basic live programming question. I didn't do great, but felt I did good enough. Later that afternoon, I get a call from the recruiter saying they want to make an offer. I'm a bit confused and honestly sketched out that they want to make an offer after only one short video call. I just assumed multiple rounds (at least 2 with Amazon).
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.797Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The contract is 3 years with an offer of 70 per hour (145k), which is a really good amount for me, but I can't help but feel concerned that there's some kind of catch (bad work environment, turnover, etc.). Currently, I'm trying to get my Actalent recruiter to set up another call with an Amazon team member to get more info, but it's been difficult. Luckily, I'll be chatting with a different Amazon engineer tomorrow.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I wanted to get some suggestions from you guys. I don't know much about contracting, so have been researching a lot the past few days. Anybody have experience with Actalent? What about working as a Contractor for FAANG? It could be a great opportunity, but I can also wait and continue looking for a Full Time position since my current job is excellent right now (decent pay and great career growth. Should I be patient or seriously consider this?
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit: talked to another Amazon lead software I’d be working with. It all sounds pretty good. He was super nice. Half the team is FTE and half is Contractor. They do the same work, attend the same meetings. It’s apparently normal for a single round interview since there are rules that the company cannot have multiple interview rounds for contractors (they are also screened by the staffing company). The Kuiper of project is one 2nd best in the company with AWS being the worse.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Overall, it seems pretty good. I would take it if my current role sucked, but it doesn’t. It’s really good actually. So, I’ve decided it’s best to keep building my skill set and interviewing for FTE roles instead.

[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: That rate is only a little more than what they pay kids straight out of college. They didn't take a lot of time deciding because that's not a big spend for them.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I imagine it'll be a rough gig, but a carefully crafted resume can make you look like you're in the FAANG gang and you could parlay it to the real deal next.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: So you’re dealing with a third party contracting company *and* working for Amazon? You must really be a glutton for punishment.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: $70/hour is *not* the equivalent of $145K.  Even if you never take a sick day and just bill for 2000 hours that  takes you down to $140K.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you take into account 3 weeks of PTO on top of that, you’re down to $131K.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most third party contracting companies have shitty insurance, so I would account for at least $6000 for health insurance.  That takes you down to $125K.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For reference, an intern I mentored at AWS ProServe had a return offer that totaled $150K with benefits and ProServe pays about 15% less than software engineers at the same level.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is a horrible offer.  Your average enterprise CRUD developer in any major city could get a better deal.  Please tell me that this at least a W2 contract and not a 1099 contract
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.798Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I actually had an Amazon recruiter reach out to me directly for the position you described and passed. There's no way I'd sacrifice my fully remote WLB and mental health knowing how their work environment is.

[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I work for Amazon, not on Kuiper, but ive been around long enough to have heard about it.  From what I’ve heard its one of the worst wlb areas in the company.  No vision, no leadership, no future.  Amazon uses contractors to get “headcount” without needing higher approval.  So you have to ask why they have the contacts.  For cost sinks that aren’t growing they use contractors to just get more people (this could be the case in this team).  For growth areas they use it to address attrition that they can’t easily hire for (amzn is actually hard to hire for and the contractor bar isnt as high).

[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.800Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.801Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.801Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.801Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.801Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.801Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.801Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.801Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:54:59.801Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks.

And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient.

[2025-05-27T18:55:10.226Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hi all, for the past 2 years, I've been working at a company doing salesforce development. In general though, I am a 'software developer' instead of a 'salesforce developer' - when this project winds down, I'll end up working on a completely different project.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.226Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I have 2 salesforce certifications and have 2 years experience, so I have been getting contacted by a lot of recruiters.  They are all offering much more salary than what I earn now, but I would be a 'Salesforce developer'.  That said, it seems like some of the offers I've gotten are contract or contract to hire positions.  I'd obviously prefer to be a full time worker...
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.226Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That said, I was wondering if salesforce developers would often get hired more on a contract basis vs a full time basis.  Obviously Salesforce implementations can vary in size, but it seems like once an implementation is done there wouldn't be much more for the Salesforce dev to do.  Or, I guess, you wouldn't need as many SF Devs on your staff.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.226Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If anyone has any input in this, or could speak to this, I would really appreciate it.

[2025-05-27T18:55:10.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: It's both. It depends on what the employer headcount budget is. Many places, for example, in silicon valley treat contractors like FTEs (with some minor curtains behind main meetings) but you are effectively an employee at 40 hours per week.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Here's been my experience in large enterprises (different industries, always on a delivery team serving internal biz partners) as I've been on both sides there. I'll leave the compensation part out as that differs wildly.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: FTE model
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Typically more say in overall buildout of tools, like design of SDLC and governance of quality.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * More stakeholders have ears for you, but may not listen to you unless you are at a lead level.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * More than 40 hours, your time is not as valueable so you'll be asked to do more for less.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * You can grow your career easier, get resources for mentorship, your asks will typically be supported by an internal manager, internal resources, or cross team support.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * You will be pulled in multiple directions, but the fires you put out will typically have more impact (again, brownie points for career growth).
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * At a dev level, you typically get the final say if you're butting heads against other contractors.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * At a lead level, you get final say on all technical decisions (barring higher level stakeholder, manager, veto rights etc).
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Deals with internal politics.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Contractor model
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * More focus on hands on responsibilities, more focus on output of code and hopefully quality.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Unless hired at a senior or lead, less domain to make architectural decisions outside of the app. Global architecture (in an org/multi org sense) is still left to FTE leads.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Hones raw skills faster as there are less meetings, less time spent not on hands on.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Not much career development unless you're looking to skill up your hands on. Fewer resources to support your asks. It'll be up to your current team dynamic to support you, which can be risky (truth be told, FTEs have the same issue but lateral moves, or getting in touch with other company resources are easier to do).
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Typically internal politics are shielded from you, not always. You'll have to deal with less overall cross team issues.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My current role is a mix of the best from the above two, a one man consultant supporting (and supported by) an FTE team.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: It's not just about implementation, the on-going development and support needed to drive a business forward is also a large consideration. A good Salesforce org is always developing and growing to support business initiatives and scale. So yes I've seen many companies with their own full-time Salesforce development teams...some prefer to try out folks by contracting first and then hiring and others might not have bdget for FTEs but can hire full-time contractors.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: You likely have your best opportunity with a Salesforce implication partner, which means multiple clients/projects where they would need someone like you for some of those projects. It's where you can maximize your value to an employer.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.228Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I suppose there are  some larger companies (often with multiple Salesforce orgs) who might need your skills full time, but working for a constancy/partner should be yield better comp.

[2025-05-27T18:55:10.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/salesforce
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It's both. It depends on what the employer headcount budget is. Many places, for example, in silicon valley treat contractors like FTEs (with some minor curtains behind main meetings) but you are effectively an employee at 40 hours per week.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Here's been my experience in large enterprises (different industries, always on a delivery team serving internal biz partners) as I've been on both sides there. I'll leave the compensation part out as that differs wildly.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: FTE model
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Typically more say in overall buildout of tools, like design of SDLC and governance of quality.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * More stakeholders have ears for you, but may not listen to you unless you are at a lead level.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * More than 40 hours, your time is not as valueable so you'll be asked to do more for less.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * You can grow your career easier, get resources for mentorship, your asks will typically be supported by an internal manager, internal resources, or cross team support.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * You will be pulled in multiple directions, but the fires you put out will typically have more impact (again, brownie points for career growth).
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * At a dev level, you typically get the final say if you're butting heads against other contractors.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * At a lead level, you get final say on all technical decisions (barring higher level stakeholder, manager, veto rights etc).
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Deals with internal politics.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Contractor model
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * More focus on hands on responsibilities, more focus on output of code and hopefully quality.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Unless hired at a senior or lead, less domain to make architectural decisions outside of the app. Global architecture (in an org/multi org sense) is still left to FTE leads.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Hones raw skills faster as there are less meetings, less time spent not on hands on.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Not much career development unless you're looking to skill up your hands on. Fewer resources to support your asks. It'll be up to your current team dynamic to support you, which can be risky (truth be told, FTEs have the same issue but lateral moves, or getting in touch with other company resources are easier to do).
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Typically internal politics are shielded from you, not always. You'll have to deal with less overall cross team issues.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My current role is a mix of the best from the above two, a one man consultant supporting (and supported by) an FTE team.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It's not just about implementation, the on-going development and support needed to drive a business forward is also a large consideration. A good Salesforce org is always developing and growing to support business initiatives and scale. So yes I've seen many companies with their own full-time Salesforce development teams...some prefer to try out folks by contracting first and then hiring and others might not have bdget for FTEs but can hire full-time contractors.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You likely have your best opportunity with a Salesforce implication partner, which means multiple clients/projects where they would need someone like you for some of those projects. It's where you can maximize your value to an employer.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I suppose there are  some larger companies (often with multiple Salesforce orgs) who might need your skills full time, but working for a constancy/partner should be yield better comp.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another person mentioned implementation partners with Salesforce. If you go this way, the “consultant” route, then you can have back to back projects that can vary wildly from one another. Depending on your perspective, that can be super fun and challenging or it could be difficult and/or annoying.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Consulting firms often hire full-time. Mine does, at least.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I’m a Developer/Architect that got “forced” into management so I could build teams around Salesforce.  The market is overfilled with what I would classify as fake developers.  All their resumes are the same, 1 year of Java, 5 years of Salesforce, claim to be experts/Senior Devs and demand 100+ per hour.  You are what I’m looking for as an FTE (or Contractor).  I want people with a real development background that “discovered” Salesforce.  You are the Unicorn.  Go get paid!  Also if you are in Minneapolis, I would like to interview you now :-)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.234Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what wo
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: rked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:55:10.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Business Context: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Campaign Focus Keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Community Tone Analysis:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. The users engage in a friendly discussion, sharing insights and advice without a rigid structure. There is a mix of **pragmatism** and **encouragement**, particularly in the way they address hiring challenges and solutions.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward and accessible, with some use of **industry jargon** (e.g., "remote," "Senior talent," "outsourcing"). There are also instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "rn" for "right now") and **casual phrases** (e.g., "got me," "breaking the bank"). The comments reflect a blend of professional knowledge and casual conversation, making them relatable to a broad audience.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but tend to be **concise**, typically ranging from one to three sentences. This brevity allows for quick exchanges of ideas and keeps the conversation flowing, which is characteristic of Reddit discussions.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**. While sentences are mostly complete, there are instances of informal phrasing and punctuation choices that reflect a conversational tone. For example, the use of rhetorical questions and direct address (e.g., "How about a nice 4-day work week?") adds to the informal
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.078Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing

[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: How does one go about hiring the right software engineers in this market?
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: We're a small team of < 20 and have generally tried not to overhire. But we're in in the market for a couple of moderately experienced (3+ years) software engineers and we don't seem to get the right applicants. 90% of them are folks right out of college, who may be good, but we can't afford to train at the moment. We're pinning our hopes on the remaining 10%, but is there a better way to attract high quality engineers? (Agencies are expensive but are they good?)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/startups
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Experienced engineers are still in demand in this economy. Your two best bets are offer 100% remote and pay more. You mentioned you don’t want to train anyone. You’ll be paying a premium for that. You can also try to hire from Eastern Europe.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I also agree that agencies are pricey rn. Try ones suggesting good talent without breaking the bank. I got some great devs through referrals in NY, but Lemon.io also got me 2 of the best engineers on the team. I was in search of Senior talent, and going into the outsourcing realm saved me a great deal of time

[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: How about a nice 4-day work week?

[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You want a **premium** (skilled developers who do not need training), but you do not want to pay for **premium**.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What about providing the equity on top of decent salary?
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.079Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:11:08.080Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:11:26.306Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.306Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **casual and conversational**. Participants engage in a friendly exchange of ideas and experiences related to the job market, particularly in the tech industry. There is an underlying sense of camaraderie among commenters, as they share insights and frustrations about hiring practices and job hunting.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.306Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.306Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is characterized by the use of **informal expressions**, including slang and abbreviations. Phrases like "0 years" (referring to recent graduates or those with no professional experience) and "lmao" (laughing my ass off) indicate a relaxed, informal style. Additionally, the use of rhetorical questions and direct address (e.g., "Do you have bad glassdoor reviews?") makes the conversation feel engaging and interactive.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.306Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.306Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length but tend to be **moderate to long**, often consisting of several sentences. This length allows for detailed responses that include personal anecdotes, recommendations, and critiques. Some comments are more succinct, particularly when expressing frustration or strong opinions.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.306Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.306Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**, with some instances of incomplete sentences or informal punctuation (e.g., "imo" for "in my opinion"). While there are no egregious grammatical errors, the style reflects a more relaxed approach to writing, typical of online

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: We are an early stage FinTech startup in the city (London). We have an office and are looking for React / Typescript developers to join us on a hybrid basis (2-3 days a week).
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Being a startup, we believe a lot of the core collaboration will happen in person, but give people time to concentrate and be productive at home when they need it.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: We are happy to hire any from 0-5 years experience.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The only caveat on 0 years experience is that they should taught themselves to code when they were younger and then took a CompSci degree. Anyone with any experience at all doesn’t need this though.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ultimately, we are just looking for good developers at whatever level who just want to build and ship!
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I don’t feel like we are being overly fussy?

[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I thought the job market was poor and it was a buyers market? Do you post on Otta (now jungle something) or Cord? Those are quite popular platforms now.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do you have bad glassdoor reviews? Competent devs can pick companies, so won’t want to work for a start up with long hours and toxic environments.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.308Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: You’re probably not advertising in the right places. A lot of people won’t travel into London as it’s quite expensive.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.309Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I hire for a company in the midlands (pretty much exclusively graduate level) and I'd honestly say a good 50% of people we interview just don't seem to grasp basic programming concepts. But we do tend to find a decent grad after a couple hundred cvs.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.309Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Now I always assumed our problem is that we are zero remote and pay pretty much the bottom of the barrel. So surprised to hear you arent getting any quality when you have location (lots of grads we interview seem to have ambitions about london), pay and remote working.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.309Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Where do you advertise? We did a basic posting on Indeed and with some local universities on their job boards and although there is a heck of a lot of crap to sift through, we do eventually find someone.

And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.309Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world.

[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Community Tone Analysis:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **casual and conversational**. Participants engage in a friendly exchange of ideas and experiences related to the job market, particularly in the tech industry. There is an underlying sense of camaraderie among commenters, as they share insights and frustrations about hiring practices and job hunting.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is characterized by the use of **informal expressions**, including slang and abbreviations. Phrases like "0 years" (referring to recent graduates or those with no professional experience) and "lmao" (laughing my ass off) indicate a relaxed, informal style. Additionally, the use of rhetorical questions and direct address (e.g., "Do you have bad glassdoor reviews?") makes the conversation feel engaging and interactive.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length but tend to be **moderate to long**, often consisting of several sentences. This length allows for detailed responses that include personal anecdotes, recommendations, and critiques. Some comments are more succinct, particularly when expressing frustration or strong opinions.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**, with some instances of incomplete sentences or informal punctuation (e.g., "imo" for "in my opinion"). While there are no egregious grammatical errors, the style reflects a more relaxed approach to writing, typical of online
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== USER PROMPT ==========
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Struggling to hire for software engineers - advice?
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: We are an early stage FinTech startup in the city (London). We have an office and are looking for React / Typescript developers to join us on a hybrid basis (2-3 days a week).
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Being a startup, we believe a lot of the core collaboration will happen in person, but give people time to concentrate and be productive at home when they need it.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: We are happy to hire any from 0-5 years experience.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The only caveat on 0 years experience is that they should taught themselves to code when they were younger and then took a CompSci degree. Anyone with any experience at all doesn’t need this though.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ultimately, we are just looking for good developers at whatever level who just want to build and ship!
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I don’t feel like we are being overly fussy?
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.310Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/cscareerquestionsuk
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I thought the job market was poor and it was a buyers market? Do you post on Otta (now jungle something) or Cord? Those are quite popular platforms now.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do you have bad glassdoor reviews? Competent devs can pick companies, so won’t want to work for a start up with long hours and toxic environments.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You’re probably not advertising in the right places. A lot of people won’t travel into London as it’s quite expensive.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I hire for a company in the midlands (pretty much exclusively graduate level) and I'd honestly say a good 50% of people we interview just don't seem to grasp basic programming concepts. But we do tend to find a decent grad after a couple hundred cvs.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Now I always assumed our problem is that we are zero remote and pay pretty much the bottom of the barrel. So surprised to hear you arent getting any quality when you have location (lots of grads we interview seem to have ambitions about london), pay and remote working.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Where do you advertise? We did a basic posting on Indeed and with some local universities on their job boards and although there is a heck of a lot of crap to sift through, we do eventually find someone.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: currently on a job hunt as a  2025grad i'd say its pretty decent for the non-0 years.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: for 0 years, i feel its a little vague. i self-taught myself how to code at 13 but it was mainly html, css, and javascript. would that count? couple that with me being predicted a first-class. im gonna assume you meant like taught themselves how to code aka they taught themselves python/java and not silly little htmls, css.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.311Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ho
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: w are the 0 years treated? other companies offer mentorships and active learnings through modules with base pay between 30-35k£ + career progression. imo this is what attracts top graduates (though i could be wrong lmao).
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ps:  may i get the link to the job postings lmao as stated above i am on a job hunt and would love to try my luck
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Your 0 year experience requirements are pathetic.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Just say you want a mid level dev and move on
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You’re also probably not paying enough. Raise it.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.312Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:11:26.313Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly **casual and conversational**, with elements of **frustration and humor**. Users express their experiences and opinions in a relatable manner, often using humor to cope with the challenges of job searching in the tech industry. There is also a sense of camaraderie among commenters, as they share common grievances about the job market.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a variety of **slang and abbreviations** typical in online discussions, such as "prolapse," "O(log n)," and "SWEs" (Software Engineers). The use of informal phrases like "it sucks," "wild how many," and "dude" contributes to the casual tone. Some comments also include technical jargon, reflecting the commenters' familiarity with programming concepts and tools.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being quite short and punchy (e.g., the first comment), while others are more elaborate and detailed (e.g., the third comment). Overall, the length tends to be moderate, allowing for sufficient explanation of points without becoming overly verbose.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**, with several instances of **informal punctuation** (e.g., excessive exclamation marks, lowercase beginnings, and incomplete sentences). There are also grammatical errors and ty

[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Fake resumes: the amount of people who lie on their resumes is insane, not only about the technologies they used but also about their work experience and education. It makes it harder for real applicants to get noticed and it makes it harder for us to hire them…
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Unable to answer basic questions: don’t say you have implemented technology X if you can’t tell me what the fuck you did with technology X. It’s fine if you don’t know the details of technology X, but tell me how you interacted with it.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. (This one is for the companies hiring) stop pushing candidates to be competitive code gamers like leetcoders, it’s a useless fucking skill and I don’t need a kid that knows how to prolapse a banana tree in O(n) time, I need someone that can design, implement and document and API.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. Reading from a text during non technical interviews, we can tell you a googling stuff, the screen light on your face is changing, you look stupid, stop it. Story: we had one dude act like the video call was frozen and would just sit there without moving but we could see the reflection of the screen in his glasses change as he was googling answers to our basic questions.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. If you are struggling in a technical interview, that’s fine, the best thing you can do is talk, talk about what you don’t understand, what you think could work, why you expected you code to work etc, also I think it’s perfectly normal to use google while sharing your screen in a technical interview, if they allow you to, please show them your googling and documentation reading skills, those are also part of the interview.

[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: This is awesome!!! Also I can prolapse a banana tree in O(log n) so you should hire me!
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: For point 2 I think a lot of the reason is because companies are asking for everything under the sun. I got recently rejected because out of the 15 technologies they used I didn’t have terraform on it. Our projects used terraform, I just never interacted with it. I can see why people start putting technologies in their resume they have maybe 5 minutes of experience with. It sucks.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: You’ve hit on a few big negatives of bad job markets for employers.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most SWEs avoid looking for a job if they have any choice.  So, employers don’t get to choose from all SWEs, just SWEs with no other choice.  Lots of good SWEs will just wait out the market and won’t risk a new job.
[2025-05-27T19:11:44.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A lot of employers have so many candidates that they seem to filter for the most desperate candidates instead of the best employee.  OAs are interesting in this way: some SWEs do OAs and some don’t but SWEs who don’t do OAs aren’t provably worse SWEs than those that do.  Similar, SWEs who are willing to do a 12-loop interview.  Employers end up choosing the best SWE from a group of very desperate SWEs.

[2025-05-27T19:12:01.553Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.554Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, with a mix of frustration and realism regarding the state of software engineering education and hiring practices in Tunisia. There is a sense of camaraderie among commenters, as they share experiences and opinions, often validating each other's points. The tone also reflects a degree of cynicism about the job market and the expectations of employers.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.554Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.555Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments frequently use **slang and abbreviations** common in tech discussions (e.g., "SWE" for software engineering, "CRUD" for Create, Read, Update, Delete). There are also instances of casual phrasing, such as "suck ass" and "bullshit," which convey strong opinions and emotions. The use of technical jargon (e.g., "RAII," "smart pointers," "OOP," "UML") indicates a shared understanding of software engineering concepts among the commenters.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:12:01.557Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Three years ago, I took a job in the UK, later transitioned to contracting for a US company, and eventually returned to Tunisia with a goal: building [Carthage Software Cooperative](https://carthage.software)—a consultancy focused on connecting highly skilled engineers with complex technical challenges. After starting legal paperwork and launching our [first job ad](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4184020927), we’ve reviewed 100+ applicants. Sadly, none met the bar. Here’s what I’ve observed, along with advice for engineers looking to level up.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.557Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # The Hiring Reality Check:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.557Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Skill Gaps**: Many applicants with 10-20+ years of experience only listed CRUD apps, API integrations, and basic frontend work. None demonstrated deep systems knowledge (e.g., compilers, static analysis, low-level tooling). Résumés often lacked evidence of **problem-solving beyond frameworks**.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Honesty Issues**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. 80% claimed Rust experience, but couldn’t explain basic ownership concepts.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. 90% mentioned "static analysis," but equated it to running `tsc`—not building tools.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. Many misrepresented English fluency (e.g., 50% answered `"Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status?"` with `yes` while being tunisian citizens?).
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **The Learning Stagnation Problem**: Too few engineers pursue intellectual curiosity outside their jobs. If your entire skillset is tied to workplace tasks, you’ll plateau.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # Advice for Aspiring Engineers:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Dig Deeper Than Frameworks**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Learn how tools work under the hood. Build a simple HTTP router, write a parser, or create a game. These projects force you to understand concepts, not just APIs.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Explore niches: Compilers, distributed systems, formal methods. These areas are underrepresented here but highly valued globally.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Be Honest (It’s Obvious)**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you list Rust on your résumé, expect to answer: “Explain the borrow checker” or “How would you optimize this unsafe block?”
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you claim expertise in static analysis, be ready to discuss abstract syntax trees or dataflow analysis.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Misrepresentation burns bridges. Tunisia’s tech community is small.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.558Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Master English**:

[2025-05-27T19:12:01.561Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overlap of skills and knowledge you're looking for is extremely rare globally let alone Tunisia. You're looking for a senior dev with expertise in Rust, PHP and static analysis. I think I can safely say there isn't a single engineer in Tunisia that qualifies. Your best bet is to find some really promising junior engineers, train them on the job and hope they don't leave by the time you're productive.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.561Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As for the knowledge and skill level of senior devs in Tunisia most developers are going to get as good as the job requires them to be. This isn't unique to Tunisia the main difference being most SWE jobs here just call for CRUD apps. No one is coming to Tunisia to hire people to work on parsers or compilers, they're hiring people to work on web apps built in Java or PHP or JS.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.561Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Totally agree with you. The problem is that most of the time, companies don't care how intelligent or curious you are, they just want someone that is familiar with their stack. The truth is, if you need to find a job as soon as possible, it's better to be a "frameworker".
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.561Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is my opinion based on my experience, (software) engineering schools in Tunisia suck ass. Students will claim they know C++ after doing some movie management project (or something like that) for class and put it on their CV, but they don't even know what RAII and smart pointers are. I know because I've been there and did that. But I guess it's okay, these are just students, but you claim there are people like this with multiple years of experience, which is much worse.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.561Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Honestly, I would've been a much better software engineer if I spent 5 years after my bac learning and building stuff that interests me instead of having to go through 2 years of bullshit prepa and 3 years of attending boring lectures.

And it all drops down to unserstanding the project. Sure ur technichal skills help at resolving problems and finding solutions but, the more u work on the project the more u understand it and the more u can optimize it. What baffels me is the recruiting process. I get asked about complicated things in depth analysis or resolving tree data structures and let me tell u that i ve never used my knowledge beyond the recruitment process. In the end it s the same code just just different architecture and file names. In my opinion it s better to find some 1 motivated eager to learn more than some 1 specific with the skills u want because u can lean those skills along the way while working on the project.

And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business.

[2025-05-27T19:12:01.562Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: rustration and realism regarding the state of software engineering education and hiring practices in Tunisia. There is a sense of camaraderie among commenters, as they share experiences and opinions, often validating each other's points. The tone also reflects a degree of cynicism about the job market and the expectations of employers.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.562Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.562Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments frequently use **slang and abbreviations** common in tech discussions (e.g., "SWE" for software engineering, "CRUD" for Create, Read, Update, Delete). There are also instances of casual phrasing, such as "suck ass" and "bullshit," which convey strong opinions and emotions. The use of technical jargon (e.g., "RAII," "smart pointers," "OOP," "UML") indicates a shared understanding of software engineering concepts among the commenters.

[2025-05-27T19:12:01.562Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length but are generally **moderate to long**, often consisting of several sentences or paragraphs. This allows for detailed explanations of opinions, personal experiences, and recommendations. Some comments are more concise, especially when asking questions or seeking advice.

[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Three years ago, I took a job in the UK, later transitioned to contracting for a US company, and eventually returned to Tunisia with a goal: building [Carthage Software Cooperative](https://carthage.software)—a consultancy focused on connecting highly skilled engineers with complex technical challenges. After starting legal paperwork and launching our [first job ad](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4184020927), we’ve reviewed 100+ applicants. Sadly, none met the bar. Here’s what I’ve observed, along with advice for engineers looking to level up.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # The Hiring Reality Check:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Skill Gaps**: Many applicants with 10-20+ years of experience only listed CRUD apps, API integrations, and basic frontend work. None demonstrated deep systems knowledge (e.g., compilers, static analysis, low-level tooling). Résumés often lacked evidence of **problem-solving beyond frameworks**.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Honesty Issues**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. 80% claimed Rust experience, but couldn’t explain basic ownership concepts.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. 90% mentioned "static analysis," but equated it to running `tsc`—not building tools.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. Many misrepresented English fluency (e.g., 50% answered `"Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status?"` with `yes` while being tunisian citizens?).
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **The Learning Stagnation Problem**: Too few engineers pursue intellectual curiosity outside their jobs. If your entire skillset is tied to workplace tasks, you’ll plateau.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # Advice for Aspiring Engineers:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Dig Deeper Than Frameworks**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Learn how tools work under the hood. Build a simple HTTP router, write a parser, or create a game. These projects force you to understand concepts, not just APIs.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Explore niches: Compilers, distributed systems, formal methods. These areas are underrepresented here but highly valued globally.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Be Honest (It’s Obvious)**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you list Rust on your résumé, expect to answer: “Explain the borrow checker” or “How would you optimize this unsafe block?”
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you claim expertise in static analysis, be ready to discuss abstract syntax trees or dataflow analysis.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.563Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Misrepresentation burns bridges. Tunisia’s tech community is small.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.564Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Master English**:

[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.566Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:12:01.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:12:15.506Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.506Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informative and supportive**. The contributors aim to provide practical advice and insights regarding hiring software developers. While the tone is primarily serious and professional, there are moments of light humor, particularly in the last comment where the mention of AI hiring developers adds a playful twist.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.506Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.506Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is predominantly **conversational**, with a focus on clarity and directness. There are no significant instances of slang or heavy abbreviations, which maintains a professional tone. However, phrases like "good feeling about" and "don't let the fear of missing out" reflect a more casual, relatable style. The use of terms specific to the field (e.g., "tech stack," "C++," "probationary period") indicates familiarity with the subject matter.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:12:15.507Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am expecting the software developer to take over the software related development so i can focus on my field of expertise. meaning that the new hire should bear with the responsibility that comes with this job as he would be the only expert in the expanding department i am in.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.507Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am feeling a bit stressed because i have never given a responsibility for such tasks, i want to be clear to the candidates on what to expect, at the same time i don't want to hear " it was your mistake hiring the wrong person " from my supervisor in the future if something goes unexpected way.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.507Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: After a long introduction, I would like to ask the following questions:

[2025-05-27T19:12:15.507Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: You should hire someone you will want to work with, and it's good if he's passionate about your area.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.507Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It's good if he has working projects with that tech stack, it's easy for an application to become a complicated mess with C++ (this is true with every language)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.508Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Usually there will be some probationary period in which the candidate, if it turns out he / she doesn't fit at all, can be let go easily.

You have a limited amount of time and effort to spend on the hiring process and you should optimize for candidates that you have a good feeling about. Don't let the fear of missing out on someone who maybe could be a good fit guide you.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.509Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In your situation, I think you want someone who can work on their own and can deal with some amount of uncertainty. There are software developers who are good, but need their tasks scoped out for them - you likely don't want someone like that. Also look for someone you'd like to work with.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.509Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One thing I like to ask when I am interviewing someone is for them to talk about something they worked on, could be anything, that they are excited to talk about. If they can explain the problem and how they solved it reasonably well, and can reflect on what they would do differently now and reason about the trade-off made, then that is a good sign. Ask them what they would do differently now, and also try and probe some of their decision making. How they react to this will also tell you a lot about the person. Examples of things they can talk about could include
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.509Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * A new feature
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.509Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Investigating and fixing a bug
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.509Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Architecting an application / software system
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Performance improvement stories
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >How many years of experience should i ask for
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Years of experience has surprisingly low correlation with skills and ability to deliver well.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Since this person will be the first and maybe the only engineer in your project, hire the best person your budget allows.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: But don't measure applicants based on years of experience.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >What other technical skills should i ask for other than the essential ones for the job (QT,VTK, C++) ?
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ask only for things you actually need. And even there, make compromises on earlier experience, if you find someone who has both technical skills and good attitude.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would ask for C++ experience and willingness to learn QT and VTK. Experience with VTK and QT as a plus.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >What values/personalities do you usually look for in a candidate?
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Willingness and ability to learn. Pragmatic. Respectful communication. Decent person.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >If you have any other advice, please go ahead!
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You would want a fair and unbiased comparison. Make a script of standard questions you ask from candidates. It's ok to adjust the script based on the things you learn during the interviews, but you need some structure and reasonable basis for comparison.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interviewing is a two ways street, you also need to sell the role to the candidates. You might want to start with an introduction of the company and the role, and have time for questions at the end.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You might want to capacity limit how many people you call in, so you can be responsive and have a smooth process for them. Don't ghost people, inform them about the next steps, also if you decide to not continue with them. Consult with HR about if you can give feedback
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:12:15.510Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:12:32.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:12:32.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A: offshore team or staff augmentation:
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you know exactly what you want to have done and you can build a roadmap, hold a team accountable to their deliverables, sense BS in a technical setting, then this is a good option. You can save money going this route if you have a somewhat time-boxed project, but you need strong management and
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.601Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: very strong communication and product direction. This may be less expensive but it costs your time and you need to know what you want.
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.601Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: B. Hire an engineer:
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.601Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It sounds like you would need to hire a Jack-of-all-trades full stack developer, and an employee of course needs management support and resources to thrive in their role. Look for someone who has experience in a few different tech stacks and languages. Expect to pay a relatively high salary for someone with experience in architecture design, team leadership, devops and systems integration. I love these people but they can be difficult to find. Lots of engineers _think_ they are like this, but it’s a special person who can fill the role of the first/only software developer at a growing company in a competitive field. This is a great longer term choice that produces good quality custom work if you find the right fit, but you need solid management and goals in place or this will frustrate you very much. You’ll also need to hire more engineers down the road, need a plan for software testing, build tech policies, all that.
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.601Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: C. Hire a 3rd party company.
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.601Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Search for “digital innovation” or “custom software” or look at “beaugmented.ai” and ask to set up an intro call. These firms can build a team of the right types of engineers, developers, managers, qa, product people and designers that fits your needs and stays in your budget. They will work with you to define exactly what you want and tell you what to expect in terms of timelines and roadmaps, they should be able to help you get to a small, working project and grow from there as your company grows. They will care about making you money because they should understand your business needs. This may be an expensive option upfront but it will get you to your goal faster and much better, especially if you don’t have a cto or technical team in-house. Unless you plan to build out a whole software team internally (at least 4 people) then this is usually the best way.
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.601Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Again, I’d love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!

[2025-05-27T19:12:32.601Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would recommend against just hiring a solitary programmer and expecting the moon. First, likely the programmer has gaps in their knowledge.

[2025-05-27T19:12:32.602Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.602Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.602Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.602Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.602Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.602Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.602Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:12:32.602Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:

[2025-05-27T19:12:47.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone:**
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. There is a blend of **pragmatic advice** and **personal anecdotes**, with a hint of **camaraderie** among users who share similar experiences in the IT industry. Some comments express a sense of **frustration** regarding the hiring process and the perception of Polish developers, while others convey **optimism** about the talent available in Poland.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.235Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns:**
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.236Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is generally straightforward, with some technical jargon relevant to the IT industry. There are instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "RPO" for Recruitment Process Outsourcing) and **informal phrases** (e.g., "ping me" for contacting someone). Some comments also include **direct address** (e.g., "yourself") and **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "crazy to hire in"), which contribute to the casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.236Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length:**
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.236Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being concise (1-2 sentences) and others more detailed (4-5 sentences). The longer comments often provide specific advice or personal experiences, while shorter comments may express a quick opinion or recommendation.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.236Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style:**
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.236Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**, with some comments containing minor grammatical errors or informal constructions

[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone:**
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. There is a blend of **pragmatic advice** and **personal anecdotes**, with a hint of **camaraderie** among users who share similar experiences in the IT industry. Some comments express a sense of **frustration** regarding the hiring process and the perception of Polish developers, while others convey **optimism** about the talent available in Poland.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns:**
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is generally straightforward, with some technical jargon relevant to the IT industry. There are instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "RPO" for Recruitment Process Outsourcing) and **informal phrases** (e.g., "ping me" for contacting someone). Some comments also include **direct address** (e.g., "yourself") and **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "crazy to hire in"), which contribute to the casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length:**
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being concise (1-2 sentences) and others more detailed (4-5 sentences). The longer comments often provide specific advice or personal experiences, while shorter comments may express a quick opinion or recommendation.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.237Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style:**
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.238Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**, with some comments containing minor grammatical errors or informal constructions

[2025-05-27T19:12:47.238Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hi there,
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.238Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am from Ireland and I am looking for some help/ advice. I currently work with a company and we are looking at creating a software application. We are struggling to find the support and people in Ireland and I am considering using remote options in Europe. From Google there is some great reviews about Polish software engineers.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.238Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Are there any companies that can assist with this? I have the idea on what needs to be done but I am very unsure of the price and time involved. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks.

[2025-05-27T19:12:47.239Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1) Best investment was a local manager with experience who could draw on their existing employees to set this up quickly with competent staff.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.239Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2) Personally interview all programmers for competency and 'cultural fit'
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.239Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3) I used agencies initially and got mediocre results, which led to the above change in strategy.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.239Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4) Polish IT market is currently crazy to hire in, high demand for skills causing high demand in wages.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.239Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'd probably not build a service desk there again today. I'd probably look at alternative slavic countries.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.239Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: If you want to stay within the EU, polish developers are by far the best around. My advice is to go with a small company or even look for individual senior developers. Large consulting companies got large by ripping off inexperienced customers like yourself and by exploiting and underpaying the workforce.

[2025-05-27T19:12:47.241Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.241Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.241Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.241Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.241Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.242Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:12:47.243Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)

[2025-05-27T19:13:09.856Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. However, it also carries a sense of **seriousness and caution**, particularly when discussing the importance of hiring the right technical talent.

[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. However, it also carries a sense of **seriousness and caution**, particularly when discussing the importance of hiring the right technical talent. The commenters express concern about the risks associated with hiring inexperienced or unqualified individuals, which adds a layer of urgency to their advice.
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward and accessible, with minimal use of jargon, making it easy for a broad audience to understand. Some comments include phrases like "good luck," "you get what you pay for," and "functional turd," which inject a bit of personality and relatability into the conversation. There are also instances of abbreviations (e.g., "SWE" for Software Engineer) and acronyms (e.g., "CTO" for Chief Technology Officer), which are common in tech discussions.
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but are generally **moderate to long**, often providing detailed advice or explanations. This length allows for a more thorough exploration of the topic, with some comments containing multiple sentences or paragraphs that delve into various aspects of hiring technical talent.

[2025-05-27T19:13:09.858Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Noob question here. I am planning to launch a business that, though not a pure “tech” company, has some core software elements. My background is more on the business side and I know next to nothing about engineering. Can anyone recommend how I might go about defining the right type of engineer for what I want to build, and then any resources for finding those folks to hire, ideally on a part time or contract basis? Thank you!

[2025-05-27T19:13:09.859Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: If you know nothing you can be taken for a ride. The kind of code and engineering you need to build for a one person shop or for a ten person shop or for a non-technical company is totally different than for a large corporate employer for example. For your case continuity of business and documentation will be extremely important as well speed onboarding new developers but to get someone who actually cares about that will be a miracle since most people don't.
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.859Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ideally you have an experienced and highly invested technical cofounder. If you don't -- good luck.
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.859Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I think you need a technical partner/cofounder. Or at least a CTO? So this person can answer all the questions you have and then proceed with the hiring process for the rest of the team/company.
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.859Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Look on LinkedIn for senior contract / freelance engineers with a record in a relevant area. Speak to a few. Discuss tech / engineering strategies at a high level. Pick one you trust to help you get the project started.
[2025-05-27T19:13:09.859Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Don't cheap out. You get what you pay for in this business. Someone cheap is cheap for a reason. You might not realise they're clueless until you have built a functional turd. They themselves might not even realise they're clueless.

That means you’re probably going to look for someone with several years of experience at the Senior Software Engineer level or above. I’d caution you to stay away from freelancers, like the ones spamming your inbox referencing this post. You want to find someone who is invested in the process, and that you can see yourself working with in the long term.

[2025-05-27T19:13:09.864Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.698Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and direct**, with a hint of **cynicism** and **pragmatism**. Commenters express a straightforward approach to discussing startup ideas and the realities of working in tech, often highlighting the challenges and pitfalls of the startup ecosystem. There is a sense of **frustration** with poorly thought-out proposals, as well as a desire for clarity and professionalism from those seeking collaboration.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Slang and Abbreviations**: The language is casual, with some use of slang (e.g., "99% of ideas are shit") and abbreviations (e.g., "MVP" for Minimum Viable Product). This reflects a familiarity with tech and startup jargon.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Direct Address**: Many comments use direct address ("If I were you," "Your job is to sell me"), which creates a conversational and advisory tone.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Imperatives**: The use of imperative sentences (e.g., "Do not be coy," "Pay market rates") indicates a strong emphasis on actionable advice.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 3. Typical Comment Length
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The comments vary in length, with some being relatively short and concise (1-3 sentences), while others are more detailed and elaborate (up to

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.700Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.700Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Based on the provided Reddit comments, here’s an analysis of the overall tone, common language patterns, typical comment length, grammar style, and how recommendations are given:
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.700Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.700Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and direct**, with a hint of **cynicism** and **pragmatism**. Commenters express a straightforward approach to discussing startup ideas and the realities of working in tech, often highlighting the challenges and pitfalls of the startup ecosystem. There is a sense of **frustration** with poorly thought-out proposals, as well as a desire for clarity and professionalism from those seeking collaboration.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.700Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.700Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Slang and Abbreviations**: The language is casual, with some use of slang (e.g., "99% of ideas are shit") and abbreviations (e.g., "MVP" for Minimum Viable Product). This reflects a familiarity with tech and startup jargon.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.700Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Direct Address**: Many comments use direct address ("If I were you," "Your job is to sell me"), which creates a conversational and advisory tone.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Imperatives**: The use of imperative sentences (e.g., "Do not be coy," "Pay market rates") indicates a strong emphasis on actionable advice.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 3. Typical Comment Length
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The comments vary in length, with some being relatively short and concise (1-3 sentences), while others are more detailed and elaborate (up to

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Lately, we have been discussing non-stop about an idea for a startup, that we very firmly believe in, and we are ready to invest every penny we made in the past.

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Since we are not that tech savvy when it comes to coding, our biggest concern is, how do we hire/find programmers who would either like to join us (another co-founder is a possibility), or hire him full time to work on the project.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Programmers, coders, how would you like to be approached when it comes to such situations?
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TL;DR - We have a startup idea and a small budget, how do we find programmers for it?

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I get approached quite often on linked in. The issue is - 99% of ideas are shit, have no chance of competing or I don't trust the person i'm talking to.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If I were you - get a freelancer, build a MVP, get investment and hire people. If you can convince an investor then you'll usually be able to convince other people your idea is a go.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Your job is to sell me the project and the vision.

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I was recently approached by a startup and agreed to join because it allows me to combine development with another interest (my background is in the music industry prior to getting into tech, and this company is in that space). Also, as a developer, it was appealing that they had decided to use a really cool tech stack, and the project requires us to solve interesting problems.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit: Point being, developers often have enough options to be picky. If your startup scratches some itch, in the subject matter, the technology used, or the type of problems that need to be solved, good devs will be a lot more likely to consider joining you, and perhaps be willing to work for a bit less than market, at least in the early stages.

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: different from any kind of static asset creation. It’s not like lego blocks or building a house from a blueprint. More like composing music or painting, it’s not a linear progress bar of doneness.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do learn that less is more and avoid piling on too many speculative features. Figure out the smallest possible feature set with no bells and whistles and just make that a perfect user experience first. Once you have users it will become easier to know what to build next.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do learn about iterative processes. The best way to succeed in software is to understand that if you want a fixed high level of quality and to keep timelines, the number one safe variable to manipulate is scope, so find ways of reducing it at every turn in order to de-risk.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do pay market rates. Cheap offshoring always fails. Expect to rewrite the entire codebase several times if you go down that route.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do not expect over time and heroic dedication just because you can think of exciting ideas for 23 hours a day. Programming requires a deep state of flow and uses much more energy than other kinds of mental work. If you expect them to perform like a cofounder then they need to have enough equity to make that realistic. But equity is worth nothing until they have created the product for you, so protect their health and work-life balance like it’s the only asset you have, because it is.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do understand that every single meeting or phone call literally subtracts from productive engineering time. Attention is a finite  and precious resource and should not be used up frivolously. It takes hours to context switch from extroverted meeting mode to introverted flow mode. Each interruption just delays timelines by the length of the interruption plus a tax of several hours. Asking for progress updates until a pre-agreed deadline is a fools errand.

[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:13:27.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:13:45.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm a software engineer at a large company based in the bay and I've recently been interviewing people quite a bit to fill mid career full stack engineering and QA Automation engineer roles. After awhile I've noticed some patterns from applicants that I wanted to share for anyone actively looking for work. These have come up multiple times in round table discussions with other interviewers about candidates and seem like easy gets if people were aware of them:
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. When doing a technical problem always explain what your game plan is before you begin to solve the challenge and why you think it will work. There is usually a brute force or naive solution that you can reach somewhat easily and many applicants jump into coding that immediately before discussing their thoughts. Depending on the role, this may or may not be acceptable, but if I'm looking for something more complex I'm happy to nudge the candidate toward a better method if that's what I'm looking for. If I just want the naive solution, I'll say its fine and to proceed - going super complex right out of the gate without explaining the naive solution may make it seem like you're over-engineering the problem or aren't practical (especially if your complex solution is wrong).  I get the sense that most candidates are anxious to prove that they can code and dive in hastily. This is considered a red flag and usually results in negative marks in the critical thinking column.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Start with test cases. Even if you don't practice test driven development, this shows foresight and gives the interviewer a chance to course correct fundamental misunderstandings about the problem at hand. Even if you don't execute them by the end, write them in comments - show the input and expected output. Try to think up as many edge cases as possible. Once you're most of the way through the problem and you realize you fundamentally misunderstood something its too late for me to help.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. If you stop talking for more than a minute people become worried about your ability to communicate your thought process. Even if you're stuck, talk about why you're stuck and if you are unable to make progress just admit it and I'm happy to offer some leading hints. I want to see that you ca
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: n think critically and program, not that you know the 'trick' to getting the optimal solution.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. If you can only do the naive solution and you're not prompted for something harder, try to explain the more complex solution when you're done as best you can. I've passed multiple people through phone screens who would not otherwise have gotten through because I knew they understood that their solution wasn't the best, they just didn't think of the optimal one immediately. If we have time and I want to see something more complex I'll ask you to try to implement it.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. In your questions for the interviewer ask about the team. Often the deciding factor for myself and my colleagues concerning a couple of candidates has been whether we got the feeling that the person would be satisfied in the role they're applying for. We don't want to hire someone who is going to leave in a year, engagement is incredibly important. On multiple occasions we have selected someone who was not quite as technically advanced as someone else because they seemed enthusiastic about what the team was working on.

[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit:
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Wow this definitely exploded. Most of the comments have been people angry about the technical interview process and I don't blame you for it - its very uncomfortable and feels artificial (because it is). I'll repeat here what I've been telling a lot of people in replies - success in the technical interview does not equate to knowing the answer. Knowing it is good, of course, but to be honest people don't get the hard problems completely right most of the time. When someone breezes through something, we jump script to something harder until we are at the point that the person has to reason through a problem. The goal is to see how the person thinks, if their reasoning and logic is sound, not that they remember an answer to a vague puzzle. If that was the goal then I would agree that technical interviews are a pretty useless indicator of actual job performance.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: As an interviewer, something I've been doing with good success over the last couple of years is sending out a very simple programming exercise to complete in advance of the interview. The candidate can do it in their own time using whatever resources they want and they can take as long as they like. The problem is very simple, something that any first year comp-sci student should be able to easily complete in an hour and an experienced developer should be able to do it in about half an hour. Most people seem to really enjoy doing the exercise - some clearly spend a lot of time on it trying to perfect their solution.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For such a simple problem, I've actually seen a huge variation in the kinds of solutions that are provided, even among people of similar experience and ability. Some people write a concise 20 line function and call it job done while some go the opposite direction and create a fully object oriented solution with multiple classes. Neither is necessarily any more correct than the other. Aside from weeding out the people who just can't program or who write awful code, what it's great for is differentiating between people who just know how to write code, and people who actually know how to engineer software, and there is a big difference.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Aside from the basics - does it actually solve the problem correctly and with reasonably well written code - what I'm really looking for are things like unit tests, documentation, build instructions (or better yet, a nice cross-platform build script), explicitly stated assumptions (e.g. whether or not to do any input validation and if so, how to handle error cases) and the overall approach.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I then spend a good portion of the interview discussing the candidate's solution. I ask them how they decided on the solution that they did, what alternatives they considered, what - if any - problems they ran into, whether they would change anything in retrospect etc. I then ask them to discuss how they would modify their solution to cope with certain changes to the requirements. What if you now had to run this on a microcontroller with a very limited amount of memory? Now what if this operation that they were assuming would be fast was actually connected to a very slow piece of hardware that took a second to respond? That kind of thing.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I've found that this is a much better indicator of ability than getting people to try to write code on a whiteboard under pressure. I can't write code on a whiteboard! Nobody codes by writing line 1, then line 2, then line 3. You end up inserting lines, moving things around, filling in loop bodies after creating the loop structure etc. Not only that, but in practice, we spend a lot of time looking up documentation and, let's be honest, places like stackoverflow. It's just not worth wasting the time to memorize a large standard library or, in some cases, certain aspects of the language or syntax (moreso for things like C++) when I can just spend 10 seconds on Google to find if the function I need exists or what is the correct signature for a move constructor again. So asking somebody to stand up at a whiteboard and do it blind is unfair, I think.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I do agree that having people *think out loud* is good. That's the thing I'm interested in! I want to know how you go about solving a problem; I want to know what your thought process is; I want to know all of the things that you're considering. I don't actually care too much about the solution you eventually come to, as long as it's well reasoned and thought out. I'd rather somebody spend 5 minutes explaining to me how they would, for example, reverse a linked list, with diagrams on a whiteboard, rather than spend 5 minutes in silence writing a perfect solution line by line on the board.

[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Shit, I was hoping this kind of "combine and sort these two lists and then turn them into a binary tree and then reverse it" nonsense was going to become less of a thing later on in my career, not so much the centerpiece that it requires a 5-point list of psychological hints.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: This advice is literally straight from the google interview youtube video. I hate that this is the way things are run, I've interviewed people and the one thing I want is people that give a shit and are willing to grind. People who are hungry to learn and strive to better in tech. I understand if you're coming in as mid level and senior but an entry level dev/ automation should just be hungry .

[2025-05-27T19:13:45.377Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Some advice to software engineering candidates from an interviewer.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.377Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: I'm a software engineer at a large company based in the bay and I've recently been interviewing people quite a bit to fill mid career full stack engineering and QA Automation engineer roles. After awhile I've noticed some patterns from applicants that I wanted to share for anyone actively looking for work. These have come up multiple times in round table discussions with other interviewers about candidates and seem like easy gets if people were aware of them:
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.377Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. When doing a technical problem always explain what your game plan is before you begin to solve the challenge and why you think it will work. There is usually a brute force or naive solution that you can reach somewhat easily and many applicants jump into coding that immediately before discussing their thoughts. Depending on the role, this may or may not be acceptable, but if I'm looking for something more complex I'm happy to nudge the candidate toward a better method if that's what I'm looking for. If I just want the naive solution, I'll say its fine and to proceed - going super complex right out of the gate without explaining the naive solution may make it seem like you're over-engineering the problem or aren't practical (especially if your complex solution is wrong).  I get the sense that most candidates are anxious to prove that they can code and dive in hastily. This is considered a red flag and usually results in negative marks in the critical thinking column.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.377Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Start with test cases. Even if you don't practice test driven development, this shows foresight and gives the interviewer a chance to course correct fundamental misunderstandings about the problem at hand. Even if you don't execute them by the end, write them in comments - show the input and expected output. Try to think up as many edge cases as possible. Once you're most of the way through the problem and you realize you fundamentally misunderstood something its too late for me to help.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.377Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. If you stop talking for more than a minute people become worried about your ability to communicate your thought process. Even if you're stuck, talk about why you're stuck and if you are unable to make progress just admit it and I'm happy to offer some leading hints. I want to see that you can think critically and program, not that you
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: know the 'trick' to getting the optimal solution.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. If you can only do the naive solution and you're not prompted for something harder, try to explain the more complex solution when you're done as best you can. I've passed multiple people through phone screens who would not otherwise have gotten through because I knew they understood that their solution wasn't the best, they just didn't think of the optimal one immediately. If we have time and I want to see something more complex I'll ask you to try to implement it.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. In your questions for the interviewer ask about the team. Often the deciding factor for myself and my colleagues concerning a couple of candidates has been whether we got the feeling that the person would be satisfied in the role they're applying for. We don't want to hire someone who is going to leave in a year, engagement is incredibly important. On multiple occasions we have selected someone who was not quite as technically advanced as someone else because they seemed enthusiastic about what the team was working on.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: &#x200B;
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If anyone wants any specifics or has questions about interviewing I'd be happy to answer but I just wanted to share with folks here the common themes I've seen in the last couple of months. Good luck everyone :)
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: &#x200B;
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit:
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Wow this definitely exploded. Most of the comments have been people angry about the technical interview process and I don't blame you for it - its very uncomfortable and feels artificial (because it is). I'll repeat here what I've been telling a lot of people in replies - success in the technical interview does not equate to knowing the answer. Knowing it is good, of course, but to be honest people don't get the hard problems completely right most of the time. When someone breezes through something, we jump script to something harder until we are at the point that the person has to reason through a problem. The goal is to see how the person thinks, if their reasoning and logic is sound, not that they remember an answer to a vague puzzle. If that was the goal then I would agree that technical interviews are a pretty useless indicator of actual job performance.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/learnprogramming
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As an interviewer, something I've been doing with good success over the last couple of years is sending out a very simple programming exercise to complete in advance of the interview. The candidate can do it in their own time using whatever resources they want and they can take as long as they like. The problem is very simple, something that any first year comp-sci student should be able to easily complete in an hour and an experienced developer should be able to do it in about half an hour. Most people seem to really enjoy doing the exercise - some clearly spend a lot of time on it trying to perfect their solution.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For such a simple problem, I've actually seen a huge variation in the kinds of solutions that are provided, even among people of similar experience and ability. Some people write a concise 20 line function and call it job done while some go the opposite direction and create a fully object oriented solution with multiple classes. Neither is necessarily any more correct than the other. Aside from weeding out the people who just can't program or who write awful code, what it's great for is differentiating between people who just know how to write code, and people who actually know how to engineer software, and there is a big difference.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Aside from the basics - does it actually solve the problem correctly and with reasonably well written code - what I'm really looking for are things like unit tests, documentation, build instructions (or better yet, a nice cross-platform build script), explicitly stated assumptions (e.g. whether or not to do any input validation and if so, how to handle error cases) and the overall approach.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.378Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I then spend a good portion of the interview discussing the candidate's solution. I ask them how they decided on the solution that they did, what alternatives they considered, what - if any - problems they ran into, whether they would change anything in retrospect etc. I then ask them to discuss how they would modify their solution to cope with certain changes to the requirements. What if you now had to run this on a microcontroller with a very limited amount of memory? Now what if this operation that they were assuming would be fast was actually connected to a very slow piece of hardware that took a second to respond? That kind of thing.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.379Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I've found that this is a much better indicator of ability than getting people to try to write code on a whiteboard under pressure. I can't write code on a whiteboard! Nobody codes by writing line 1, then line 2, then line 3. You end up inserting lines, moving things around, filling in loop bodies after creating the loop structure etc. Not only that, but in practice, we spend a lot of time looking up documentation and, let's be honest, places like stackoverflow. It's just not worth wasting the time to memorize a large standard library or, in some cases, certain aspects of the language or syntax (moreso for things like C++) when I can just spend 10 seconds on Google to find if the function I need exists or what is the correct signature for a move constructor again. So asking somebody to stand up at a whiteboard and do it blind is unfair, I think.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.379Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I do agree that having people *think out loud* is good. That's the thing I'm interested in! I want to know how you go about solving a problem; I want to know what your thought process is; I want to know all of the things that you're considering. I don't actually care too much about the solution you eventually come to, as long as it's well reasoned and thought out. I'd rather somebody spend 5 minutes explaining to me how they would, for example, reverse a linked list, with diagrams on a whiteboard, rather than spend 5 minutes in silence writing a perfect solution line by line on the board.

[2025-05-27T19:13:45.379Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Shit, I was hoping this kind of "combine and sort these two lists and then turn them into a binary tree and then reverse it" nonsense was going to become less of a thing later on in my career, not so much the centerpiece that it requires a 5-point list of psychological hints.

I hate that this is the way things are run, I've interviewed people and the one thing I want is people that give a shit and are willing to grind. People who are hungry to learn and strive to better in tech. I understand if you're coming in as mid level and senior but an entry level dev/ automation should just be hungry .

[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons

[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:13:45.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.
