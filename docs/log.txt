[2025-05-27T19:32:10.694Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.694Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, with a mix of **supportive and advisory** elements. Commenters express genuine interest in helping others navigate the complexities of software development. While some comments are straightforward and pragmatic, others convey enthusiasm and encouragement, especially when discussing potential solutions or projects.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.694Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.694Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is generally **accessible and straightforward**, avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary. There is a mix of **casual phrases** (e.g., "I would *love* to chat about this") and **more technical terms** related to software development (e.g., "full stack developer," "devops," "QA").
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Abbreviations and acronyms are used (e.g., "CTO," "PM"), but they are typically explained or contextualized. Some comments include **slang** (e.g., "BS" for "bullshit"), which adds to the informal tone.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with some being quite **concise** (1-2 sentences) while others are **detailed and extensive**, providing thorough explanations and multiple options. The longer comments often break down complex ideas into manageable sections (e.g., A, B, C options), indicating a thoughtful approach to the topic.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:32:10.697Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: 1. It depends on the size of the projects, timelines, budget and expected quality (keeping in mind not all large firms produce timely (nor sometimes quality) code/software.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.697Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Software developer is a broad term, so you’d likely (partly to ensure quality, partly to find the right people generally) need to search for the programming language expected, or someone with experience making similar products. The former of these is harder if you’re not a software developer, but it’s often good to look around at existing similar systems and understand what languages they use, pros and cons, and go from there, but this approach isn’t entirely necessary, it depends on how much time/interest you have!

[2025-05-27T19:32:10.698Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Wouldn’t the nature of such request be better suited for a company with a development team and not necessarily an individual?
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.698Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. What is the job title I should be researching? Software developer, programmer, etc?
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.698Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is the start of the journey for us, we are a small business. I understand this may seem naive but every company has to start somewhere, so I’m trying to gain as much helpful information and resources possible so that I can help guide us properly.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thank you!

[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Don't, it will not work out. Get something off the shelf. Unless you have six digit budget and few years to complete.

[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. It depends on the size of the projects, timelines, budget and expected quality (keeping in mind not all large firms produce timely (nor sometimes quality) code/software.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Software developer is a broad term, so you’d likely (partly to ensure quality, partly to find the right people generally) need to search for the programming language expected, or someone with experience making similar products. The former of these is harder if you’re not a software developer, but it’s often good to look around at existing similar systems and understand what languages they use, pros and cons, and go from there, but this approach isn’t entirely necessary, it depends on how much time/interest you have!

[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: How did it go? Very curious to see how things went since it's been a year!

[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would *love* to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a handful of things you need to consider: how involved do you want to be? How much $ do you want to invest? What is your tolerance for risk? And, where is your expertise? Then you have a few options.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A: offshore team or staff augmentation:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.699Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you know exactly what you want to have done and you can build a roadmap, hold a team accountable to their deliverables, sense BS in a technical setting, then this is a good option. You can save money going this route if you have a somewhat time-boxed project, but you need strong management and very strong communication and product direction. This may be less expensive but it cos
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.700Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ts your time and you need to know what you want.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: B. Hire an engineer:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It sounds like you would need to hire a Jack-of-all-trades full stack developer, and an employee of course needs management support and resources to thrive in their role. Look for someone who has experience in a few different tech stacks and languages. Expect to pay a relatively high salary for someone with experience in architecture design, team leadership, devops and systems integration. I love these people but they can be difficult to find. Lots of engineers _think_ they are like this, but it’s a special person who can fill the role of the first/only software developer at a growing company in a competitive field. This is a great longer term choice that produces good quality custom work if you find the right fit, but you need solid management and goals in place or this will frustrate you very much. You’ll also need to hire more engineers down the road, need a plan for software testing, build tech policies, all that.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: C. Hire a 3rd party company.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Search for “digital innovation” or “custom software” or look at “beaugmented.ai” and ask to set up an intro call. These firms can build a team of the right types of engineers, developers, managers, qa, product people and designers that fits your needs and stays in your budget. They will work with you to define exactly what you want and tell you what to expect in terms of timelines and roadmaps, they should be able to help you get to a small, working project and grow from there as your company grows. They will care about making you money because they should understand your business needs. This may be an expensive option upfront but it will get you to your goal faster and much better, especially if you don’t have a cto or technical team in-house. Unless you plan to build out a whole software team internally (at least 4 people) then this is usually the best way.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Again, I’d love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!

[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You...may want to employ a company that makes line of business software.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It depends on how complex your needs are.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would recommend against just hiring a solitary programmer and expecting the moon. First, likely the programmer has gaps in their knowledge. If not, they are likely either very expensive or very inexperienced (and faking it). Finally, having someone test their own work is bad practice.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.701Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:32:10.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:32:31.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Here are some options I am considering:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Upwork, Fiverr
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Google
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Asking around on social media..?
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: Figure out what "good" means for your team - seniority, specific languages? Having that clear vision, our CEO consulted with Lemon.io, and kudos to them. It went stress-free all the way. Hope your experience is just as easy
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: When I want to hire someone, I usually find them through Reddit, I go into subs specific for what I need to hire, then I look for the person who adds the most value via comments. I reach out to 10-15 redditors and usually hire from there.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It has never failed me in over 40 hires.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I used Fiverr to make a simple CLICKER/IDLE game and the cost was 1,500 USD with all set up and running in the GooglePlayStore.  As many people have mentioned using Fivver is a " Hit or Miss" as dar as quality development.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My experience working with the Developer from Fivver was not bad but you will have to look at many portfolios and try ask questions to decipher WHO , appears to have the knowledge to bring to life your project.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I can say that price range varies and its backed by the developer's experience for the most part. I seen some work that I liked but the prices are based on same great work. I am onna budget so I went with basically one of the cheapest  developer's for my project.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Things to keep in mind... you get what you are paying for literally. The European and Americans appear to charge the most because of skills and so I opted to go with a cheaper PAKISTANI developer.  Things to keep in mind if opting for cheaper routes.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TIME ZONE DIFFERENCE: I had free time between the hours of 2am till 5am and in Pakistan it was afternoon,  so this worked out well in my case.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: LANGUAGE BARRIER: during vetting process asking questions will allow to get a feel for the developer's English speaking and compression. My developer was having poor grammar in English but made up for it with SUPER quick responses and example; when I logged into game I can then say hey man you spelled these words wrong , spell it like this.....he would quickly go and fix spelling so language for me was not a huge issue.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: WORK ETHIC  : here is where things get dicey and basically I recommend to break your project down in sections or Phases. Example;  when I spieled my apps plan and gameplay he quoted me 1,500 dollars and I agreed. Next I broke the apps vision in 3 phases.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: PAYMENT: I used the in app Fiverr payment system and everything was fine. I paid 500 dollars and gave developer EXACTLY what I wished for...... after 1 week he produced the results then asked me for a revision  or 2 and when I was happy I then pay him 500 dollars in Fiverr for Phase 2 then 500 for final phase 3
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Conclusion; I would use service
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: again but my game was Idle/clicker very easy. These 3 sections  I completed basically completes  CHAPTER/PHASE  1 of the entire game that when finished will take another 2 phases. Its important to have EVERYTHING ready for these low price developer's because the price point will not allow them to be or want to be creative and spend more time than they have to on your project and therefore being ready and knowing exactly what you want is key.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Last advise, in last phase and last revisions TAKE YOUR TIME trying to find bugs. Click on everything,  enjoy game, reset and basically tinker ,tinker , tinker to find as many bugs for it to be fixed in final and ultimate revision.  I failed this step and it will cost me about 2 or 3 hundred dollars to fix. Example of bug I did not catch during revision ; when you scuba dive to collect gold then when you upgrade the TILE to level 2 the tile would change to a more advanced TILE but the ( bug) I did not catch was that the ( Level marker still would say LEVEL 1 TILE instead of changing to LEVEL 2 because the tile was upgraded and looks better and nicer but it would still say underneath Level 1
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.408Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: All in all, its doable to make a low price app on Fivver but you must know ALL details and have alot patience as most Devs are foreign speaking languages.

They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Community Tone Analysis:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. While some comments maintain a level of professionalism, they often include personal anecdotes and casual expressions that create a relaxed atmosphere. There is a mix of **supportive** and **cautionary** tones, especially when discussing experiences with hiring developers and using freelance platforms.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is characterized by **colloquial expressions** and **slang** (e.g., "kudos," "hit or miss," "spieled").
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Abbreviations** and informal terms are prevalent (e.g., "Fivver" instead of "Fiverr," "Tbh" for "to be honest").
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is also a tendency to use **direct address** (e.g., "Cheers to all!") and **first-person narratives**, which adds a personal touch to the advice being shared.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.409Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with some being quite **detailed and lengthy**, particularly those sharing personal experiences or providing comprehensive advice. Others are shorter and more succinct, focusing on specific points or questions. The longer comments often contain multiple paragraphs, while shorter ones may be just a sentence or two.

[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: How do you guys find good developers to hire?
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Here are some options I am considering:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Upwork, Fiverr
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Google
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Asking around on social media..?
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/Entrepreneur
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Figure out what "good" means for your team - seniority, specific languages? Having that clear vision, our CEO consulted with Lemon.io, and kudos to them. It went stress-free all the way. Hope your experience is just as easy
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: When I want to hire someone, I usually find them through Reddit, I go into subs specific for what I need to hire, then I look for the person who adds the most value via comments. I reach out to 10-15 redditors and usually hire from there.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It has never failed me in over 40 hires.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I used Fiverr to make a simple CLICKER/IDLE game and the cost was 1,500 USD with all set up and running in the GooglePlayStore.  As many people have mentioned using Fivver is a " Hit or Miss" as dar as quality development.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My experience working with the Developer from Fivver was not bad but you will have to look at many portfolios and try ask questions to decipher WHO , appears to have the knowledge to bring to life your project.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I can say that price range varies and its backed by the developer's experience for the most part. I seen some work that I liked but the prices are based on same great work. I am onna budget so I went with basically one of the cheapest  developer's for my project.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Things to keep in mind... you get what you are paying for literally. The European and Americans appear to charge the most because of skills and so I opted to go with a cheaper PAKISTANI developer.  Things to keep in mind if opting for cheaper routes.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TIME ZONE DIFFERENCE: I had free time between the hours of 2am till 5am and in Pakistan it was afternoon,  so this worked out well in my case.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: LANGUAGE BARRIER: during vetting process asking questions will allow to get a feel for the developer's English speaking and compression. My developer was having poor grammar in English but made up for it with SUPER quick responses and example; when I logged into game I can then say hey man you spelled these words wrong , spell it like this.....he would quickly go and fix spelling so language for me was not a huge issue.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: WORK ETHIC  : here is where things get dicey and basically I recommend to break your project down in sections or Phases. Example;  when I spieled my apps plan and gameplay he quoted me 1,500 dollars and I agreed. Next I broke the apps vision in 3 phases.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: PAYMENT: I used the in app Fiverr payment system and everything was fine. I paid 500 dollars and gave developer EXACTLY what I wished for...... after 1 week he produced the results then asked me for a revision  or 2 and when I was happy I then pay him 500 dollars in Fiverr for Phase 2 then 500 for final phase 3
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Conclusion; I would use service again but my game was Idle/clicker very easy. These 3 sections  I completed basically completes  CHAPTER/PHASE  1 of the entire game that when finished will take another 2 phases. Its important to have EVERYTHING ready for these low price developer's because the price point will not allow them to be or want to be creative and spend more time than they have to on your project and therefore being ready and knowing exactly what you want is key.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Last advise, in last phase and last revisions TAKE YOUR TIME trying to find bugs. Click on everything,  enjoy game, reset and basically tinker ,tinker , tinker to find as many bugs for it to be fixed in final and ultimate revision.  I failed this step and it will cost me about 2 or 3 hundred dollars to fix. Example of bug I did not catch during revision ; when you scuba dive to collect gold then when you upgrade the TILE to level 2 the tile would change to a more advanced TILE but the ( bug) I did not catch was that the ( Level marker still would say LEVEL 1 TILE instead of changing to LEVEL 2 because the tile was upgraded and looks better and nicer but it would still say underneath Level 1
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: All in all, its doable to make a low price app on Fivver but you must know ALL details and have alot patience as most Devs are foreign speaking languages.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Cheers to all !
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most things on Fiverr are a crap shoot. Upwork can be the same but maybe a bit better. I would always suggest looking over the developers portfolio and asking them about the process they use. Things like how the workflow works. This can be a quick way to weed out some of the bottom tier developers.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What are you looking to develop? I may be able to give you better direction on where to look.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What's your budget or the assumed budget of the competition? Above a certain budget I'd think you'd want to find a vendor or shop instead of dealing with independent contractors on sites like upwork. FWIW depending on the scope of your project I'd say look on subreddits like experienced devs.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.411Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:32:31.412Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Just to clarify, I'm not recruiting anyone on this thread, so I don't think it necessarily breaks the 'no soliciting employment' rule. I will also not be responding to any self-promotions in comments or DM's via Reddit, though if you can recommend a good dev through a reputable site that's different.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm just curious what the best place to find reputable programmers to hire is for working on games. My project is pretty big in scope, and while I am somewhat decent at coding, I'm more of the design/animation etc guy and would ideally like to hire a programmer, or maybe even two, to help me work on the core framework of my game to get it done in a reasonable amount of time.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm ideally looking for something where I can hire someone that I can work *with,* being able to review and go over stuff that is being developed, as opposed to paying someone to go off and make something for me without any input or consultation during the development process. Preferably something where a dev would be open to being hired again in the future to fix bugs, add new content etc as well.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I know this will be pretty damn expensive, like easily in five figures, as it's a full-scale game I'm working on and I still have a few months of saving I need to do before I'm ready to actually hire anyone, but I'm just trying to get to know my options and possibly even talk to a few programmers who could provide consultations, advice on developing a game design document and so on.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Any advice is appreciated, and again I want to emphasize that ***I will not be responding to any self-promoting Reddit DM's or comments!*** If you would like to recommend a specific dev or something, I'm looking to see reputable portfolios and sites that will handle the commission etc.

[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I mean, it definitely can be tricky finding platforms that let you work directly with engineers while handling commissions and other mundane stuff. Look into some guys like Lemon.io, who clearly state that they won’t meddle with day-to-day work. So far, no issues for me
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: You've got quite a few options really:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * You can check out /r/ForHire and the more gaming industry focused /r/GameDevClassifieds. Tons of people are there but the main issue is that you'll have to deal with the logistics and legality on your own. It is free to post of course.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * There are some Discords that freelance game devs frequent such as [Game Dev League](https://discord.com/invite/0TYNJfCU4De7YIk8), the official [Unity Discord](https://discord.com/invite/unity) (if you're going to use Unity) and the most popular [Unreal Discord](https://discord.com/invite/unreal-slackers). Same as the above, legality and logistics are your own.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * There is [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) that is more geared towards freelance work but works as well for long term contracts. The website is setup so it takes care of logistics and some of the legalities for you. It is free to post the job but you may need to pay a percentage when paying the freelancer (depending on the agreement, either the freelancer will load it up in the price he is quoting or will eat it instead).
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * There is also [WorkWithIndies](https://www.workwithindies.com/) and [RemoteGameJobs](https://remotegamejobs.com/) but there is a fee (usually ~$50 one time payment) to post there. This is more geared towards traditional hiring processes.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you are serious about this and can pay industry standards -- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is a good one. Free to post and to hire but the extra "recruiting stuff" (i.e. advertising, sponsoring, etc...) is paid.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Finally, you can get a little bit creative (especially if you have the money for it) and reach out to reputable outsourcing companies. Though these are going to probably cost you quite a lot. I heard of a couple [Cathar Games](https://www.cathargames.com/en/index.html) (for clarity, I know the founder and we used to chat a lot a few years ago) and [Streamline Studios](https://www.streamline-studios.com/) (for clarity, an ex-colleague of mine knows them and if I recall correctly his previous company worked with them).
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: With this description it sounds like you're looking for actual career oriented professionals and not your average gig developer. That is going to be very expensive. To give you an idea I would not do that contract for less than $50 an hour, assuming you don't provide typical benefits. So for two full time engineers you're looking at around 200k a year, give or take. To find those kinds of guys you should be posting on actual job boards like LinkedIn.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **casual and conversational**. The contributors engage in a friendly manner, sharing insights and advice without a formal structure. There is an underlying sense of camaraderie among users, which is typical of Reddit discussions.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language features a mix of **informal expressions and industry-specific jargon**. Terms like "logistics," "legalities," and "freelance" indicate familiarity with the professional context, while phrases like "you can check out" and "you should be posting" maintain a casual tone. There are also instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "i.e." for "that is") and **links** to external resources, which is common in Reddit discussions to provide additional context.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, but they tend to be **moderately detailed**, often comprising several sentences to a few paragraphs. This allows users to provide comprehensive advice while still being concise enough to maintain reader engagement.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar is generally **casual**, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or conversational phrases. While the contributors convey their points clearly, they do not adhere strictly to formal grammar rules, which is typical in informal online discussions. For example, the use of "you know" or "I mean" reflects a spoken style
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.921Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like

[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using

[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.922Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention

[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it

[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: )
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:32:49.923Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2.

[2025-05-27T19:33:03.427Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-RESULT] Reasoning: The thread shows a strong match because the user is actively looking for developers to hire, which aligns closely with New CCO Vibe's service of providing software developers. The need for reputable programmers and the mention of hiring for a big project are directly related to the campaign focus of finding software developers. The user's interest in affordable and efficient development also aligns with New CCO Vibe's value proposition. However, the focus on game development is somewhat tangential to internal tools, which slightly reduces the score.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I would suggest you make a document/slides that would explain your idea. What you are trying to solve, who are your target customers, references the developer can look at to understand how this idea works (if there are existing apps that are already doing your idea), and what features you are thinking of to be part of the MVP.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then you can start looking for developers that can help you make the idea into reality.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you are thinking of making the app available for both Android and iOS, I would suggest looking for Mobile Developers who knows React Native, a framework that allows developers to use the same code to publish apps for both Android and iOS.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can look for developers via LinkedIn, Upwork, Fiverr, or just googling. Posting on subreddits like this helps as well.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I found my developers on Upwork after posting a detailed description of what I want + provided design
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I think the wireframes or low quality design is great to the success of any project before engaging developers or even designers. You will be surprised how many times you will change your mind about some features/layouts.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For me to de-risk the process I got a UX guy to do the designs for the app (paid them $15/hour) and I got a specialist to advise on the best "Tech stack" so I won't be taken on a ride with the developers.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: From my experience developers work better if you provide your design. Adobe XD is free and it has free templates that you can use, so get started. There are plenty of other wireframing/prototype apps out there that you can also use.

[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Business Context: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:33:11.516Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Campaign Focus Keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Community Tone Analysis:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informative and supportive**. The commenters aim to provide practical advice and insights based on their experiences, which creates a helpful atmosphere. There is a sense of encouragement, particularly in the suggestions for finding developers and preparing project documentation.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is **straightforward and technical**, reflecting familiarity with app development. There are some **abbreviations** (e.g., MVP for Minimum Viable Product, UX for User Experience) and references to specific tools (e.g., Adobe XD, React Native) that indicate a shared understanding among those in the tech community. The use of phrases like "you can look for developers via LinkedIn, Upwork, Fiverr" suggests a practical, no-nonsense approach.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments are generally **moderate in length**, providing enough detail to convey useful information without being overly verbose. They balance between being concise and thorough, often breaking down complex ideas into manageable parts.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is **casual but coherent**. While the comments are not overly formal, they maintain a level of professionalism appropriate for the context. There are minor grammatical errors or informal constructions, but they do not detract from the clarity of the message.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **How People Give Recommendations**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Recommendations are given in a
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== USER PROMPT ==========
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Where to hire/ find app developers?
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: I have an idea and need a dev, how do I find the right one?
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/Entrepreneur
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would suggest you make a document/slides that would explain your idea. What you are trying to solve, who are your target customers, references the developer can look at to understand how this idea works (if there are existing apps that are already doing your idea), and what features you are thinking of to be part of the MVP.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then you can start looking for developers that can help you make the idea into reality.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you are thinking of making the app available for both Android and iOS, I would suggest looking for Mobile Developers who knows React Native, a framework that allows developers to use the same code to publish apps for both Android and iOS.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can look for developers via LinkedIn, Upwork, Fiverr, or just googling. Posting on subreddits like this helps as well.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I found my developers on Upwork after posting a detailed description of what I want + provided design
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I think the wireframes or low quality design is great to the success of any project before engaging developers or even designers. You will be surprised how many times you will change your mind about some features/layouts.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For me to de-risk the process I got a UX guy to do the designs for the app (paid them $15/hour) and I got a specialist to advise on the best "Tech stack" so I won't be taken on a ride with the developers.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: From my experience developers work better if you provide your design. Adobe XD is free and it has free templates that you can use, so get started. There are plenty of other wireframing/prototype apps out there that you can also use.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Right here!
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: First things first, do you need a developer or an app agency? Yes, that's where you start. A freelance app developer will be ideal for your project if you're starting and have limited funds. However, if you're seeking to build an enterprise-class app, you should consider hiring a full-fledged agency for your project.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.517Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:33:11.518Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:33:26.060Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hi, I am leading a small team of 4 people and we was developing a small workflow automation tool. Unfortunately our lead developer had to part way from us for certain reasons. Apparently he wanted to begin his venture. It was quite sad for me but I figured that I should respect his decision.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.060Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For that reason I am planning to find a new developer. But that COVID-19 situation made me unable to meet new people in person. Then I decided to try hiring freelancers but honestly I am not sure if it would work well.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.060Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I used to hire a freelance designer via Fiverr to help designing a logo. But that is too different than hiring a developers. Therefore I would like to ask if there is anyone has hired freelance developer before?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.060Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I wish to know where is the good source to find quality developers. And also what should I pay attention to when hiring freelance developers?

[2025-05-27T19:33:26.060Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: Have a look for contributors to GitHub and Stackoverflow. Maybe look for solution to a question you already have solved in your project.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.060Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Hiring Development resources is tough, and getting scammed or ripped off is pretty easy on sites such as Fiverr or Upwork.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.060Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'd suggest going through an agency and getting a dedicated vetted engineer for your team. Not as cheap, but much higher quality and over site.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.060Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Disclaimers: I started 3 startups with that model, and now I run an agency that provides that after seeing how it worked with us. PM me if you need more info.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: If you're not technical yourself then it'll be very hard for you to judge the competency of developer, especially if they're not honest with you. The best thing that you can do it to require them to provide references for previous clients who they've done similar work for, and then to speak to those clients about their experience with the developers.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Some questions you can ask to try and identify the difference between proper developers and people who can write code (although be aware that if you don't understand these concept, they can probably just BS you):
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What development methodology do they follow?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do they manage source control?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Do they use tests as part of the development process?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do they backup their code?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What documentation will they provide alongside the code?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What secure development practices do they use?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One of the biggest issues is a mismatch in expectations between the two sides when outsourcing development. Before speaking to them, you need to be clear on:
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What are your functional requirements?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What are your non-functional requirements?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you verify that the developed software meets these requirements?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What is are your deadlines (and are they realistic)?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What is your budget?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What happens if the project goes overbudget or overtime? Are you paying per hour, or a fixed price for the work?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What happens if you make changes to the original design or what additional features added?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Do you require ongoing support, or do they deliver the tool and then you're done?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What about fixing bugs?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Will your receive the source code alongside the working tools? What about documentation, build scripts and instructions, etc?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What level of security do you need for the tool? How will the developers provide this? If it needs third party testing, who will pay?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will the delivery process work? Will you get given the software at the end of the process, or will they provide incremental version updates so you can test them as you go (such as using an Agile development process).
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you monitor progress throughout the project to ensure that it's on track?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you pay them? Upfront? Once the project is completed? In stages when they meet specific milestones?
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.061Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You should also be very cautious of outsourcing development to India/Bangladesh/etc. The prices will look much cheaper up front, but while I'm sure there are some very good developers out there, you generally get what you pay for. I've seen companies "save" a fortune by outsourcing development to India, and then 12 months down the line having to write off the entire project and start from scratch because what was delivered was fundamentally unfit for purpose. I'm not saying that it can't work out well, but if you're not technical then it's going to be very easy for them to pull the wool over your eyes and BS you.

Unfortunately our lead developer had to part way from us for certain reasons. Apparently he wanted to begin his venture. It was quite sad for me but I figured that I should respect his decision.

[2025-05-27T19:33:26.063Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a lot of places, ranging from /r/forhire to the tech slacks to the job sites like Indeed. But that's not really the tricky part. I have a company that finds developers for entrepreneurs, including freelance and remote, and it's not so much a matter of where you go to get developers as the kind of screening you do. That's basically what I'm getting paid for; although I have some pro places to find developers, really, my value added is that I'm good at telling if a candidate is the right fit. So here's the sort of things you should do:
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.063Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you post a job ad, ask the candidate questions that make it clear whether they actually looked at what the job was. There are freelancers who just respond to every listing out there without even reading them. You don’t want them.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.064Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Be clear about what you want the candidate to do. It's non uncommon for a candidate to accept a job that isn't what they're good at because they misunderstood what the employer was looking for.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.064Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Ask for examples of previous work. Pay attention to the stuff that is as close as possible to what you want them to do.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.064Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * When you look at someone's previous work, focus on the details. How dedicated are they to getting the job done right? A hard worker who follows best practices beats out a sloppy genius.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.064Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don't go for the cheapest guy. There's a reason why he's the cheapest guy. Similarly, if you offer a really low hourly rate, you'll be disappointed by who applies for the opening.
[2025-05-27T19:33:26.064Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Attitude matters. If a candidate is acting like a jerk or being continually late with their responses when they haven't even been hired yet, they're not going to improve once they've gotten the job.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:33:41.004Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.004Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.005Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)

[2025-05-27T19:33:41.006Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.006Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.006Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.006Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:33:41.006Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:33:58.256Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.256Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.257Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **professional** and **friendly**. While the comments maintain a level of professionalism appropriate for discussions about software development and pricing, they also exhibit a casual friendliness, particularly in the use of greetings and expressions of willingness to engage further.
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.257Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.257Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly **straightforward and technical**, with some use of industry-specific terminology (e.g., "frontend," "backend," "SaaS").
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.257Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is a mix of **formal and informal language**; for instance, some comments use contractions (e.g., "I’m," "let’s") while others are more structured.
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.257Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Abbreviations like "dm" (direct message) are common, indicating familiarity with online communication norms.

[2025-05-27T19:33:58.257Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but tend to be **moderate**. They are long enough to convey relevant information about the commenter’s experience and willingness to engage, but not excessively verbose. Most comments are a few sentences long, providing a balance between detail and brevity.
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.257Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.257Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**.

[2025-05-27T19:33:58.259Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:33:58.260Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **professional** and **friendly**. While the comments maintain a level of professionalism appropriate for discussions about software development and pricing, they also exhibit a casual friendliness, particularly in the use of greetings and expressions of willingness to engage further.
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.260Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.260Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly **straightforward and technical**, with some use of industry-specific terminology (e.g., "frontend," "backend," "SaaS").
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.260Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is a mix of **formal and informal language**; for instance, some comments use contractions (e.g., "I’m," "let’s") while others are more structured.
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.260Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Abbreviations like "dm" (direct message) are common, indicating familiarity with online communication norms.
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.260Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.260Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but tend to be **moderate**. They are long enough to convey relevant information about the commenter’s experience and willingness to engage, but not excessively verbose.

[2025-05-27T19:33:58.262Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.262Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.262Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.262Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using

[2025-05-27T19:33:58.262Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.262Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:33:58.263Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.384Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.385Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is primarily **informal and conversational**. Some comments express skepticism or critique, particularly regarding data interpretation and hiring practices, which adds a layer of **candidness**. The tone also fluctuates between **analytical** (in the more detailed comments) and **frustrated** or **dismissive** (in comments expressing doubts about the data).
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.385Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.385Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is characterized by a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "O*NET occupation codes," "software engineer") and **everyday language**. Some comments feature **slang** (e.g., "Aint skurred") and **abbreviations** (e.g., "ADP"). The use of **keywords** related to the software industry is prevalent, reflecting familiarity with the subject matter.
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.385Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.385Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, with some being quite **concise** (one or two sentences) while others are more **elaborate** and detailed, especially when discussing methodologies or expressing doubts. The longer comments often provide context or ask clarifying questions, indicating a desire for deeper engagement.
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.386Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.386Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**. While some comments are well-structured and grammatically correct, others exhibit informalities such as **sentence fragments**, **contractions

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is primarily **informal and conversational**. Some comments express skepticism or critique, particularly regarding data interpretation and hiring practices, which adds a layer of **candidness**. The tone also fluctuates between **analytical** (in the more detailed comments) and **frustrated** or **dismissive** (in comments expressing doubts about the data).
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is characterized by a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "O*NET occupation codes," "software engineer") and **everyday language**. Some comments feature **slang** (e.g., "Aint skurred") and **abbreviations** (e.g., "ADP"). The use of **keywords** related to the software industry is prevalent, reflecting familiarity with the subject matter.
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, with some being quite **concise** (one or two sentences) while others are more **elaborate** and detailed, especially when discussing methodologies or expressing doubts. The longer comments often provide context or ask clarifying questions, indicating a desire for deeper engagement.
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**. While some comments are well-structured and grammatically correct, others exhibit informalities such as **sentence fragments**, **contractions

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: This doesn’t look right. Hiring for software engineers was in a frenzy at least into 2021. A peak in January 2020 makes no sense.
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.389Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: >To identify software developers in the ADP sample, we independently matched two criteria, job titles and O*NET occupation codes, followed by review and filtering of the results. A set of employees was identified by querying a set of keywords present in known software developer job titles (such as software engineer, C++ developer, stack developer) and querying O*NET occupation codes for software developers (15-1252.00, 15-1253.00, 15-1254.00 and 15-1221.00). Combined data resulting from these queries was manually reviewed to weed out any job titles captured erroneously. Because the list of resulting job titles was quite long, a rule of thumb was applied to job titles that occur fewer than 2,500 times. These had to contain the key words “software” or “developer” to be included in the sample
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.390Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I doubt this captures everything, because businesses won't always hire "software developers". My position is considered "programmer/application analyst", and unless that's within their predefined wording, it might not even be captured correctly.

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.393Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Why was Jan 2018 chosen? Was employment already on a steady upward trajectory, making this movement downward (by only ~80%; the graph seems designed to make it seem worse) more of a correction?

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.393Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.393Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.393Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.393Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.393Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt

[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:34:15.394Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers).

[2025-05-27T19:34:27.595Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. The commenters express personal experiences and opinions in a straightforward manner, often using first-person narratives. While some comments touch on serious issues like hiring practices and communication barriers, the tone remains relatively relaxed and approachable.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly **straightforward and direct**, with a focus on clarity. There are instances of **colloquial expressions** and informal phrases, such as "good luck," "fillers," and "cheapest labor." Some comments also include **bullet points** for clarity and organization, which is common in online discussions. Abbreviations like "PRs" (pull requests) and "EST" (Eastern Standard Time) are used, indicating familiarity with technical jargon and time zones.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, but they tend to be **moderately detailed**, often consisting of several sentences to a few paragraphs. This allows for a thorough explanation of experiences and perspectives while remaining concise enough for easy reading.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.596Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**. While most comments are coherent and follow standard grammatical rules, there are occasional typos and informal constructions (e.g., "durring" instead of "during"). This reflects the spontaneous nature of online discussions where perfect grammar is not a priority

[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k.

[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. The commenters express personal experiences and opinions in a straightforward manner, often using first-person narratives. While some comments touch on serious issues like hiring practices and communication barriers, the tone remains relatively relaxed and approachable.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly **straightforward and direct**, with a focus on clarity. There are instances of **colloquial expressions** and informal phrases, such as "good luck," "fillers," and "cheapest labor." Some comments also include **bullet points** for clarity and organization, which is common in online discussions. Abbreviations like "PRs" (pull requests) and "EST" (Eastern Standard Time) are used, indicating familiarity with technical jargon and time zones.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, but they tend to be **moderately detailed**, often consisting of several sentences to a few paragraphs. This allows for a thorough explanation of experiences and perspectives while remaining concise enough for easy reading.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**. While most comments are coherent and follow standard grammatical rules, there are occasional typos and informal constructions (e.g., "durring" instead of "during"). This reflects the spontaneous nature of online discussions where perfect grammar is not a priority
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== THREAD CONTENT ==========
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My question is primarily towards the developers based in North America who have experience hiring developers overseas.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What issues have you run into? What are the pros and cons?
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: It’s a few things. Timezone differences, lack of direct communication, language barrier, etc.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A lot can be remedied by strict rules on PRs and good reviewers. Async messaging can be great, and for longer things videos can help. But you really just lack connection inherently to external teams, especially when they’re in countries with vastly different longitudes
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Maybe about India:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * there are many wonderful developers. But if they are good their salary is to much for company looking for cheapest labor overseas. Or they already migrated to e.g. USA
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * there are some interview scams - one person is good on interview, but other person shows up to work
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * there are some really common things when hiring whole teams - 1 or 2 devs from 6 person team actually work and the rest is so weak that they are just a "filler". When you complain you get more "fillers"
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * another thing is cultural one - they will agree to literally any schedule etc., regardless if it possible or not. OFC it will not be delivered on time in most cases, so good luck if you base your client estimate on that
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I am a developer working for a client that is currently stationed in New Jersey and I am in N. Macedonia so I can point out how it is from the other end:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The most obvious one is the different timezones. We are 6 hour apart so we have meetings around 9AM EST which is their starting time. Sometimes when we need to discuss something that occured durring the day we'll have a meeting again at 4PM EST. Client is happy with this arrangement and so am I. But I set the expectations in the initial talks that I am only available from 9AM - 11AM and after 4PM EST. Reason for that is that I have a family I want to spend time with between those hours.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - client mentioned that he had issues previously with a developer which did not have a good understanding of the job he was hired to do. This means that it was a bad hire and/or was cheating the interview process somehow.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - client also mentioned that few developers had a very thick accent and low vocabulary so that was a big issue as well. Personally, I've been told I have a russian sounding one, but it's still understandable and I have a good vocabulary. Probably from the 4 years I spent living in the US.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Payment and receipts. We got around this by using upwork as a third party service. I could also have opened a company here and do it that way, but we both agreed for this option for the time being.
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.597Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If I think of something else I'll be sure to add it here. I hope this helps

[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.599Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:34:27.600Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)

[2025-05-27T19:34:45.487Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: Based on the provided Reddit comments, here’s an analysis of the overall tone, language patterns, comment length, grammar style, and how recommendations are given:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.487Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.487Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overall tone of the comments is **pragmatic and somewhat critical**. The commenters express a sense of realism about the challenges of hiring developers and the startup process. There is an underlying seriousness as they emphasize the importance of investing in quality talent and the pitfalls of seeking cheap or inexperienced help. While some comments are direct and straightforward, others incorporate a touch of **sarcasm** or **humor** (especially in the empathy exercise), highlighting the absurdity of unrealistic expectations from potential clients.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.487Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.488Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The language patterns are mostly **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. There is a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "MVP," "full stack," "NDA") and straightforward language that makes the comments accessible to a broader audience. Some comments use **slang** and casual phrases (e.g., "bleed you dry," "run circles around"), while others maintain a more professional tone, especially when discussing experience and qualifications.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.488Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 3. Typical Comment Length
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.488Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The comments vary in length but are generally **moderate to long**. They often contain multiple sentences with detailed explanations or lists (as seen in the empathy exercise and the structured recommendations). This length allows for thorough responses, showcasing the commenters’ expertise and providing comprehensive

[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Based on the provided Reddit comments, here’s an analysis of the overall tone, language patterns, comment length, grammar style, and how recommendations are given:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overall tone of the comments is **pragmatic and somewhat critical**. The commenters express a sense of realism about the challenges of hiring developers and the startup process. There is an underlying seriousness as they emphasize the importance of investing in quality talent and the pitfalls of seeking cheap or inexperienced help. While some comments are direct and straightforward, others incorporate a touch of **sarcasm** or **humor** (especially in the empathy exercise), highlighting the absurdity of unrealistic expectations from potential clients.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The language patterns are mostly **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. There is a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "MVP," "full stack," "NDA") and straightforward language that makes the comments accessible to a broader audience. Some comments use **slang** and casual phrases (e.g., "bleed you dry," "run circles around"), while others maintain a more professional tone, especially when discussing experience and qualifications.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 3. Typical Comment Length
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The comments vary in length but are generally **moderate to long**. They often contain multiple sentences with detailed explanations or lists (as seen in the empathy exercise and the structured recommendations). This length allows for thorough responses, showcasing the commenters’ expertise and providing comprehensive

[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Greetings Reddit!
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I have 3 great ideas that I’ve been holding on to for dear life. My mission was to learn to code myself, but then my wife and I began having children and there’s just never enough time. I’m now to the point where I feel like if I don’t start, I never will and I’m not trying to miss out in a world where tech in now crossing leaps and bounds.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Years ago I started on one of the ventures (the biggest one) by finding young coders out of college. I had them all sign NDAs and we’d meet every other weekend. Initially, I approached them with a stake in the company and once they completed, we discuss percentages. I wanted to go this route to continue to motivate them (much like how FB was started). After negotiating, we decided on me paying them for the work, with a discussion about percentages once the job was completed. The problem with that was, there would be 0 progress until we met. Because I was funding it alone, I pretty much canceled everything because I didn’t feel they were taking it seriously. After about 3 months, we only got as far as a sign-in with 2 step verification. I’m not sure if that is standard time for it, but it was buggy and I found myself asking them to fix it often. I swear I’m not a micromanager. I provided the designs for it, and they weren’t coming close on the backend.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Today, I’ve ready to move forward with another idea but I do not want to run into the same issues I did previously which had me shelve the idea for 11 years (which still isn’t close to being done today). Here’s my question… where do I find trusted, professional, developers to help me get this idea into the world? Does such a platform exist?
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Please help! Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.489Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: It's pretty simple. You need to find a professional. This means that you'll have to pay them well, because good developers charge appropriately. Trying to find students or the cheapest developers on websites like Upwork has a high chance of not ending well (Internet is full of these kind of stories). In other words, you get what you pay for. Problem with shares is that they're worth nothing until the company starts making a reasonable profit. You probably know that most startups fail, and most new companies close within the first year. So, to me at least, shares are not a great way of compensation. The only exception would be if I your devs really believed in the product. But in my experience it's kind of tough to 'sell' the idea and ignite that much passion to a stranger who has no experience in the field. As a dev I spoke to a few people and even though I liked some of the ideas I never liked them that much to be able to sacrifice months of hard work for a mere chance, if things went well.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Lastly, one place / platform where all the 'good' developers gather doesn't exists. All of them are full of all sorts of developers. If you're not looking for free labour, I'm currently looking for a project (I am a professional dev with 10y of experience and a software engineering degree)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Don’t hire developers. Find a technical cofounder or if you can hire a CTO type. Hiring technical talent without being technical yourself is tricky.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: And honestly if you were paying those first guys, sounds like you got ripped off if they only got as far as auth.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also project management can make or break you. Coordinating talent and budgeting resources is a specialty, again don’t try to do it seriously yourself the first time. Let your cto handle that.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you have a budget and market you can focus on that and make sure you and your cto are in sync.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Feel free to dm me if you’d like to chat I do some consulting for first timers and can help you kind of get a lay of the land.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As to where to hire, it all depends on if you have a budget or not. With a budget you have lots of options.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I’ve been in the software engineering business for quite some time. I do projects for people as well as myself. Here are some issue with trying to protect an idea.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. If I sign your NDA, it could prevent me from taking on a project from another client with a similar idea.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. An NDA represents liability. A 20k project with 100k in liability is a not worth it.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.490Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I always tell people that I will always agree not to reveal YOUR information like sales, strategies, clients etc. But I would never consider restricting what ideas I can implement.

[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am a lead engineer with over 15 years of experience. I've owned some large projects at FAANG and other fortunate 500 companies that most people have used. My recommendation is always to work on a collaborative and transparent process but being flexible at the same time. Even with the backing of companies like Amazon, it has never been a strict process. It is always an iterative process as development happens, requirements change, and adaptations happen. I am starting my own shop hoping to provide small business with the same bar and rigor as these huge enterprises I have worked for. Keep in mind, what you are offering is probably why people didn't work until you met. Most junior devs need to focus on learning so you need to accommodate for that time. Of course you can hire professionals like myself who have a lot of experience but you would need to have a professional process and payment. Most professionals won't sign up for working for free without payment until the end because we can easily find work for pay. If you are serious, this is an investment. Every serious business requires investment. Not trying to be harsh but just realistic. If you expect college kids to work for you, the quality of work will be the same as they have to learn a lot initially. If you want real results with a defined process and structure, I would recommend you reevaluate your process. I provide development and consulting services. Happy to have discussions if you want.

[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Unless you have serious cash to burn I recommend not hiring developers. Youre not a business yet with cash flow or even something which can generate even just a single dollar.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Its really just an idea you have and nothing more.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The other thing is that a lot of these comments where people are talking about you hiring them or having a shop of developers you should really just avoid. They will bleed you dry. Think about updating this app, what about iterating on the idea for market fit, what about bug fixes, what about getting their technical buy-in, what about owning the IP of the code?
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What you need is a technical co-founder. Someone with at least 3-5 years of full stack experience who will buy into your idea and build the prototype without it costing both of you anything beyond 1000 USD.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Every single dollar in the idea phase is precious, dont ever commit to spending until you have real cash flow.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: With the prototype out and maybe 5 - 10 clients who are willing to pay or have paid. You now have a working MVP with proof of cash flow, you can now extrapolate future cash flow, cost curves and so on and build a go to market plan along with a strategy on how to capture the market you believe is capture-able.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can now try raise some capital through seed rounds. After getting your initial seed, you will need to both quit your jobs and both of you focus on building the business. This is still an extremely hard phase probably even harder than the prototyping phase
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.492Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract softwa
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.493Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: re developers.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:34:45.494Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:35:01.499Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.499Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **candid and somewhat critical**. Commenters express frustration and skepticism about the quality of freelancers and the challenges of hiring temporary developers. There is a mix of **informal and professional** language, reflecting a casual yet knowledgeable perspective on the topic. Some comments convey a sense of resignation regarding the difficulties of finding reliable freelancers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.499Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.499Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is generally **straightforward and conversational**, with phrases like "hit or miss" and "gobbled up" indicating a casual style. There are instances of **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "throw bodies at it") and some technical jargon related to software development (e.g., "full stack developers," "Next.js"). Abbreviations and acronyms are not heavily used, but there are references to specific technologies and practices that suggest familiarity with the field.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.499Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.499Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, but many are **moderately long**, providing detailed insights and personal experiences. This suggests that commenters are willing to invest time in articulating their thoughts, likely due to the complexity of the topic. Some comments are concise, particularly when responding to specific questions, while others are more elaborate, offering in-depth analysis or personal anecdotes.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:35:01.501Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: From my experience (as a freelancer myself) the good to bad ratio is 25/75. Finding quality freelancers is super hit or miss with mostly misses. Most of the time there's no way of verifying the freelancer's abilities and they lie a ton and WAY oversell their abilities. The world of freelancing is full of 3-month bootcampers who call themselves full stack developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.501Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Freelancers are also guilty of subcontracting to cheaper freelancers. You're going to pay them $40/hr to get $15/hr quality, because they're subcontracting with someone in the Philippines.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.501Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It's typically the case that quality developers don't freelance or they're always gobbled up by high paying clients. So, there's always slim pickings among freelancers. You'll end up hiring and firing a string of them before finding someone good.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.501Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: > Just wanna hear what everyone thinks about looking for temporary devs to help finish a feature quicker
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.501Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hiring contractors to help finish a project will almost always make it take longer. You need to hire them before you begin the project if you want contractors to be effective.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.501Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Offshoring is super hit or miss. We worked with a local friend that had developer contacts back home - first few jobs went smoothly, then the last one that we needed done as a last-minute emergency (that we were being charged for) was awful. Dev clearly used a HTML email template builder to build out a solid chunk of the site.

[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It's typically the case that quality developers don't freelance or they're always gobbled up by high paying clients. So, there's always slim pickings among freelancers. You'll end up hiring and firing a string of them before finding someone good.

[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: > Just wanna hear what everyone thinks about looking for temporary devs to help finish a feature quicker
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hiring contractors to help finish a project will almost always make it take longer. You need to hire them before you begin the project if you want contractors to be effective.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Offshoring is super hit or miss. We worked with a local friend that had developer contacts back home - first few jobs went smoothly, then the last one that we needed done as a last-minute emergency (that we were being charged for) was awful. Dev clearly used a HTML email template builder to build out a solid chunk of the site.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: To their credit, they made it look almost okay on desktop.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you want a feature done sooner the only way to do that is throw bodies at it or reduce scope. The only way to effectively through bodies at a problem is to have onboarded engineers that can be pulled off other work. Contractors take time to spin up so unless you bring them in at the start of a project it's just making it slower. And you need to bring in enough that their added throughput at the end offsets their reduced throughput in the beginning as they onboard to your team.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is also why you hire months before you start major projects. You want time for people to settle in and become
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: productive.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Or you just talk to product and reduce scope, shifting non-essential pieces to a later phase.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It depends. As someone who has freelanced for a really long time, it's a very dicey situation
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Too many hit and miss. For every 10 developers you meet, 8 are fresh guys from bootcamps or some YouTube "build a shopify clone in 5 mins" fresher.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I've worked with Next.js since it was less popular, for a really long time, and a lot of devs still don't know about next.js, many still find the App / pages router confusing
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There's a bandwagon of self acclaimed developers and you're most likely to meet a pile of those, when hiring freelance developers
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One way we did circumvent this at a time, was to get a senior and trusted developer to join in on the interview process, that way, you can avoid surprises
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.503Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:35:01.504Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

Talking with our startup clients, we often hear how difficult it is to hire good developers. I hope this will be helpful to you in solving your recruitment pains. It's a text I wrote based on my conversation with our Head of Service Delivery, Wojciech Lichota. He has 10 years of experience hunting for developers on our competitive market.*

[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **The Ultimate Guide to Hiring High-Impact Software Developers, Part One**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Who doesn’t need software developers these days? Startups are always looking for fresh talent to get their idea off the ground.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: But before you can start working on your software project, you need the people who can actually do the coding. You need skilled programmers who can bring real value. And those are notoriously hard to get.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Read on for an inside look at the challenges of hiring software developers - and how you can meet those challenges head on using outbound tactics like LinkedIn, workshops and hackathons.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Why is it hard to find software developers?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The Number One Problem with hiring software developers is competition. The bigger the city you’re in, the fiercer the fight to hire the best. You might think that a larger market could provide a more healthy stream of devs, but in reality it’s almost impossible to hire good developers in places such as London or the Silicon Valley. Top talent gets sucked up by the major players in the blink of an eye, leaving you straining to find anyone to work on your project.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hiring software engineers is especially tricky for companies without a well established, prestigious brand. If you fall under this category, you may find that developers either don’t want to join you or will leave you as soon as the project stops exciting them.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The market is very much skewed towards the developers themselves, who can pick and choose the companies that will provide the best benefits and compensation.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: All is not lost, however.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.194Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: While the competition may be fierce and high-impact developers are ever harder to recruit, the task is not impossible. I know this because I recently sat down with Wojciech Lichota, Head of Service Delivery at the Gdańsk branch of STX Next. I asked him to share
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: his process for finding developers you can be proud of. Here’s what you need to know to start hiring great software engineers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **What are your options?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: When you set out on the search for software developers, you have two main courses of attack.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Option One: Hire a headhunting agency**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A potentially effective solution, albeit a costly one. If you decide to hire a headhunting agency to fulfill your recruitment needs, you’re looking at paying the equivalent of 1 or 2 monthly paychecks of the new hire as remuneration for the agency. This amounts to around 15,000 PLN in Poland.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In the UK or US, on the other hand, you may pay as much as 25% of the hire’s yearly salary. On average, that’s £30,651 in the UK and $69,083 in the US.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Investing such amounts in new hires may pay off in the future, but the initial cost will delay the moment when you start seeing a return on your investment.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Option Two: Recruit by yourself**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The alternative to headhunters is to take the recruitment effort upon yourself, which is a significant challenge. However, depending on the size of your company, this solution may prove more cost-effective.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One of the obstacles with ‘insourcing’ your software engineer recruitment is that you may not have the right skillset onboard to find good hires. For example, your HR department may find it challenging to identify and entice quality candidates.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: On the other hand, your project managers may try to tackle the task themselves; they may know their way around software development, but are they comfortable enough in the recruiter role to get the job done?
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Such challenges were the inspiration for our series of articles. We’re here to share the best practices that, in our experiences, lead to valuable software development hires.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Let’s see what you can do to give yourself a fighting chance in this competitive market.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Outbound recruiting methods**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This article will focus on outbound methods of recruitment. Using the outbound approach, your strategy is to find viable candidates for your software engineering positions and entice them to apply for a job at your company. (This stands in contrast to developers finding you, which is the inbound approach. More on that in another post.)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A tall order to be sure, but there are proven tactics you can use to increase your odds of swaying developers to your side, ranging from classic LinkedIn messages to more creative methods such as workshops and hackathons.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Direct search via LinkedIn and other portals**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The classic way of reaching potential software development hires is to send them a message through LinkedIn or a similar medium. **This method is classic for a reason - it’s fundamental to your recruitment success.** In our case, it’s still the number one channel for finding new developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The key difference between success and failure here is the way you compose your first message, or your ‘outreach’. A good first contact message reflects the best practices found in the best sales emails. It must be interesting and effective. Ask yourself: **what can I include in the message to make it impossible to ignore?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Outreach tips:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * **You must include the salary range in your message.** This has become an industry standard by now.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * **Include the location of your job posting.** Keep in mind that most developers aren’t looking to relocate and you will have to make your deal even sweeter to get them to do it.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.195Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * **Tell the candidate about the technologies they’ll be working with.** Any bleeding edge technologies you may be using could entice the developer to choose you.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * **The message should end with one, crystal-clear call to action.** This could be either ‘email us’ or ‘visit our website’ or ‘schedule a call’. Again, the next step should be clear as day; don’t force the candidate to think.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If there are other aspects of your offer you’d like to highlight in the outreach, here’s one simple rule to follow: choose the benefits that separate you from the competition. Those are your key selling points and you should point them out first. If your company has great employee benefits, you can add a few words about them. If it’s a modern and exciting project, make sure the candidates know about that.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However, make sure that the content of your outreach is all killer and no filler. **The purpose of this message is to impress the candidate, not inform them of all the details.** That comes later.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Recruitment via knowledge sharing: conferences, workshops and hackathons**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A less straightforward but nonetheless effective recruitment method is sharing your organization’s tech knowledge at conferences, workshops and hackathons. It’s a win-win situation: you give the event attendants a chance to educate themselves while at the same time gaining an opportunity to grow your network and expose new people to your organization.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The first issue to take into account here is location, location, location. Think small and local. You have a much higher chance of success if you address a more focused, more motivated group of candidates during a smaller event. Attending larger events may raise awareness and prestige, but the audience may be from all over the continent. There’s not a lot of hope that you will find someone that fits your location.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Second, keep in mind that this recruitment tactic requires technical knowledge. You may turn to your CTO to help you here. Their combination of technical and business savvy gives them the right skillset to ensure an interesting conference presentation or practical workshop content.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Whenever you organize or participate in an event, you should think in terms of a recruitment funnel. You need enough people attending the event to sift out those that will be either uninterested or unqualified, and get the gems that you can hire.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Let’s dig a little deeper into how you can ensure success for each type of event.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **2 tips for effective conference presentations**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: When it comes to making an impact during a conference presentation, Wojciech shared with me two key nuggets of knowledge.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: His first piece of advice is simple: don’t be selfish! When preparing your content, you should ask yourself: **how will my audience benefit from attending my presentation?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Keep in mind that this is very different from looking into how you will benefit from making the presentation. That goal should not be your main focus; the attendants will catch on to it.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Wojciech’s second tip is much more specific and relates to live coding at conferences. Again, his answer is blunt: **just don’t do it.** Live demos during a presentation create a lot of problems for little to no benefit. Even if it’s smooth, it takes up way too much of your precious time. The audience is just watching you type!
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Additionally, it’s incredibly easy to make a mistake in your code and then waste even more time on debugging, hunting for that one mistyped line as your authority falters.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For those reasons, it’s much better to show ready-made code snippets and keep the show going smoothly.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Depending on the target audience you choose, you should also choose appropriate content. **Juniors** seek basic knowledge. They don’t want lectures or speeches; they’re mostly looking for knowledge akin to a programming course. **Advanced attendants** will be more interested in case studies of interesting projects. Make sure to present something concrete and focused.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The matter of junior vs advanced attendants also comes into play when you’re looking to organize a workshop.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Workshops: junior or advanced?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Organizing a practical workshop yourself can be even more effective than attending a conference with your presentation. The downside, of course, is that it requires much more work and preparation involving many people in your organization. You are the host here, after all.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The most pivotal decision to make here is whether to gear your event towards juniors or more advanced developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.196Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It’s easier to conduct workshops for junior attendees - but do you want to recruit junior developers? Ask yourself this question in advance before you end up with a
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.197Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: n unproductive event.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.197Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: On the other hand, you can conduct advanced workshops. Keep in mind, however, that they are much more time-consuming to organize. You could spend many hours of work - even a whole month - preparing to pull of just one short event. Moreover, you’ll need to bring in experienced speakers and the audience will be harder to convince - both to attend and to take interest in your job offers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.197Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Filtering: when your workshop is a little too successful**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.197Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another issue to tackle with junior workshops is how you filter potential attendants. Usually your workshops will require at least a minimum of starting knowledge, even if they’re geared towards relative beginners.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.197Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: To process the influx of submissions and get worthwhile attendants, you need to establish an **automatic skills test**. Anything else will create too much work to process the event smoothly.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.197Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As an example, our Has Power workshops include a short, 4-question quiz. Attendants are invited based on their quiz answers and their LinkedIn profile. The need for careful selection is very real for us, since we usually have 2-3 people for each spot at workshops such as Python Has Power.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.197Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Hackathons: managing expectations**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.197Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another idea that has been gaining prominence among software houses and tech companies is organizing hackathons to attract programming talent.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The idea of a hackathon is quite simple. You book a venue. You order food and beverages for your attendants (beer is absolutely fine!). You invite potential candidates to participate in a fun coding project. Finally, you try to hire the ones that stand out the most.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hackathons work especially great if you’re a startup. You can even establish a theme for your hackathon such as VR, IoT, Big Data, AI - anything that’s exciting and fits your startup profile. Invite developers to come, code something, show off their idea and get prizes for the best projects. This way you can pre-select devs who have useful skills for your purposes.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You should keep in mind, however, that while hackathons can be easier to organize than workshops, they are also more expensive. Without an appropriate budget for food, drinks and prizes, you might fail to meet expectations.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: **your hackathon must be fun!** This type of event is all about creativity, so leave a lot of room for the attendants to run with their ideas. Don’t impose stiff limitations.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Oh, and one last thing. Don’t expect that people will come and create amazing software you can sell. The event shouldn’t support your product; it should bolster your recruitment. We’ve seen hackathons that were all about ‘cheap coding labor’ and rest assured, they are the very opposite of fun.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Summary**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One thing I can say for sure after my meeting with Wojciech is that recruiting developers is a deep subject. So deep, in fact, that it couldn’t possibly fit into one post. Which is why you can look forward to more in the near future!
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: And just because I know how busy you might be today, here’s a short recap of what we’ve covered so far:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **LinkedIn:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Your best bet to find good developers is probably still via direct LinkedIn outreach.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * A good outreach should be impressive and interesting. Put emphasis on your key advantages over the competition.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Information such as salary, location, tech stack and the next action to take are a must.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Conference presentations:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Prepare basic, course-like knowledge for junior attendants and case studies for advanced guests
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Think first about how the audience will benefit from seeing your presentation, not how you will benefit.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don’t do live coding - the risk of wasting your audience’s time is too great.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Workshops:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Keep in mind that a good workshop can take up to a month to organize properly.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * You should organize junior workshops only if you want junior developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Make sure to pre-filter your attendants using an automatic skills test.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Hackathons:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Make sure you have a budget that can support food, drinks and prizes for the attendants.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Feel free to give your hackathon a theme fitting your profile to attract the right programmers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don’t treat the hackathon as a source of free labor to build your product!
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Wow, even the recap got pretty long. All the more reason to revisit the subject very soon.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: *And that's the full body of the blog post (minus the obvious calls-to-action at the end). Hope you found it helpful.

[2025-05-27T19:35:22.198Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: As a developer:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Put the salary range in your ads, don't waste my time. The same with the _real_ flexibility on location, working remotely, etc.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don't insist on a phone call just to describe the job which can be hard to schedule, just send an email regarding benefits, etc.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Interview (or send me the tests) straight away with those who make the actual decisions, so decisions can be made quickly
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don't waste time looking for references, if you really want them then ask for them on the first interview/contact. If you don't really need them (are they really trustworthy anyway?) then don't waste the time.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Try to make the interview problems constructive and interesting to discuss, I once had to just sit an hour long exam with no internet access, etc. and it was terrible and completely useless to judge and learn from.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Make any tests/exercises have a clear goal and set time. It sucks being asked to "deep dive" on a problem when I'm still working 50-55 hours a week and barely have time to get interviews, etc. arranged.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I've always had trouble with companies just delaying too much so I took other offers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Do not promote the CEO or the company, why would I be interested if you have a A rated startup with a world level CEO but I am getting half of what I could get somewhere else with less stock options.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Start from how I will benefit from taking the job in short term and long term. Focus on what will be on the job offer not the future potentials.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Great Post! As a developer situated somewhere between the labels of junior and advanced I think it's worth noting that we "midrange" devs do exist and that both advanced course-like presentations and more accessible case studies will appeal to us, and, upon thinking further, to any dev. Learning and knowledge are spectra, are processes of becoming.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In general it would be wise to categorize developers with some more granularity than just "junior" and "advanced." At least one more level of categorization added to your planning can help make your events much more widely appealing and can attract the middle group of devs (presumably the largest group).
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hackathons must be fun! Not much to add here. I suppose it would be good to offer your tech stack as a template, perhaps provide a db of random tables that aren't necessarily restrictive creatively for devs to access, but then let the devs add to and subtract from the stack. Also, offer multiple categories of competition.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Linkedin messages can validate younger devs, while they may be seen as "just one more" in the ever-growing-stack-of-credit-card-applications inbox(500+) of a more experienced developer. Make sure all your messages have a personal touch, and even more so for more experienced devs.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.199Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Offer learning. Opportunities to augment the learning of current technologies and frameworks give you a unique competitive advantage! Though keep in mind that there are devs who are hungry learners (I know I am!), and there are devs who are not. Hire those who are hungry. If you're concerned about parsing the hungry learners from those who are not, just ask for code samples. The learners will undoubtedly have a trove of things they've been "just playing around with."

[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments can be described as **direct and assertive**, with a hint of frustration. The commenters express their opinions and experiences candidly, often emphasizing their expectations and the shortcomings they perceive in the hiring process. While there is a level of professionalism, the tone leans towards being **conversational and informal**, typical of Reddit discussions.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward and lacks excessive jargon, making it accessible to a broad audience. There are instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "etc."), and some comments include **casual phrases** (e.g., "it sucks," "don't waste my time"). The use of **rhetorical questions** (e.g., "why would I be interested...") adds a conversational flair. Some comments also use **technical terms** relevant to the software development field, indicating the commenters' familiarity with the industry.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but generally fall within a **medium range**. They are long enough to convey detailed thoughts and suggestions but short enough to maintain reader engagement. The first two comments are more concise and focused, while the third comment is more elaborative, indicating a willingness to share nuanced perspectives.

[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Who doesn’t need software developers these days? Startups are always looking for fresh talent to get their idea off the ground.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: But before you can start working on your software project, you need the people who can actually do the coding. You need skilled programmers who can bring real value. And those are notoriously hard to get.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Read on for an inside look at the challenges of hiring software developers - and how you can meet those challenges head on using outbound tactics like LinkedIn, workshops and hackathons.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Why is it hard to find software developers?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The Number One Problem with hiring software developers is competition. The bigger the city you’re in, the fiercer the fight to hire the best. You might think that a larger market could provide a more healthy stream of devs, but in reality it’s almost impossible to hire good developers in places such as London or the Silicon Valley. Top talent gets sucked up by the major players in the blink of an eye, leaving you straining to find anyone to work on your project.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hiring software engineers is especially tricky for companies without a well established, prestigious brand. If you fall under this category, you may find that developers either don’t want to join you or will leave you as soon as the project stops exciting them.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The market is very much skewed towards the developers themselves, who can pick and choose the companies that will provide the best benefits and compensation.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: All is not lost, however.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.200Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: While the competition may be fierce and high-impact developers are ever harder to recruit, the task is not impossible. I know this because I recently sat down with Wojciech Lichota, Head of Service Delivery at the Gd

[2025-05-27T19:35:22.201Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: When you set out on the search for software developers, you have two main courses of attack.

[2025-05-27T19:35:22.201Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A potentially effective solution, albeit a costly one. If you decide to hire a headhunting agency to fulfill your recruitment needs, you’re looking at paying the equivalent of 1 or 2 monthly paychecks of the new hire as remuneration for the agency. This amounts to around 15,000 PLN in Poland.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.201Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In the UK or US, on the other hand, you may pay as much as 25% of the hire’s yearly salary. On average, that’s £30,651 in the UK and $69,083 in the US.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.201Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Investing such amounts in new hires may pay off in the future, but the initial cost will delay the moment when you start seeing a return on your investment.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.201Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Option Two: Recruit by yourself**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.201Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The alternative to headhunters is to take the recruitment effort upon yourself, which is a significant challenge. However, depending on the size of your company, this solution may prove more cost-effective.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.201Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One of the obstacles with ‘insourcing’ your software engineer recruitment is that you may not have the right skillset onboard to find good hires. For example, your HR department may find it challenging to identify and entice quality candidates.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.201Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: On the other hand, your project managers may try to tackle the task themselves; they may know their way around software development, but are they comfortable enough in the recruiter role to get the job done?
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Such challenges were the inspiration for our series of articles. We’re here to share the best practices that, in our experiences, lead to valuable software development hires.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Let’s see what you can do to give yourself a fighting chance in this competitive market.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Outbound recruiting methods**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This article will focus on outbound methods of recruitment. Using the outbound approach, your strategy is to find viable candidates for your software engineering positions and entice them to apply for a job at your company. (This stands in contrast to developers finding you, which is the inbound approach. More on that in another post.)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A tall order to be sure, but there are proven tactics you can use to increase your odds of swaying developers to your side, ranging from classic LinkedIn messages to more creative methods such as workshops and hackathons.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Direct search via LinkedIn and other portals**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The classic way of reaching potential software development hires is to send them a message through LinkedIn or a similar medium. **This method is classic for a reason - it’s fundamental to your recruitment success.** In our case, it’s still the number one channel for finding new developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The key difference between success and failure here is the way you compose your first message, or your ‘outreach’. A good first contact message reflects the best practices found in the best sales emails. It must be interesting and effective. Ask yourself: **what can I include in the message to make it impossible to ignore?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Outreach tips:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * **You must include the salary range in your message.** This has become an industry standard by now.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * **Include the location of your job posting.** Keep in mind that most developers aren’t looking to relocate and you will have to make your deal even sweeter to get them to do it.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * **Tell the candidate about the technologies they’ll be working with.** Any bleeding edge technologies you may be using could entice the developer to choose you.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * **The message should end with one, crystal-clear call to action.** This could be either ‘email us’ or ‘visit our website’ or ‘schedule a call’. Again, the next step should be clear as day; don’t force the candidate to think.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If there are other aspects of your offer you’d like to highlight in the outreach, here’s one simple rule to follow: choose the benefits that separate you from the competition. Those are your key selling points and you should point them out first. If your company has great employee benefits, you can add a few words about them. If it’s a modern and exciting project, make sure the candidates know about that.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However, make sure that the content of your outreach is all killer and no filler. **The purpose of this message is to impress the candidate, not inform them of all the details.** That comes later.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Recruitment via knowledge sharing: conferences, workshops and hackathons**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A less straightforward but nonetheless effective recruitment method is sharing your organization’s tech knowledge at conferences, workshops and hackathons. It’s a win-win situation: you give the event attendants a chance to educate themselves while at the same time gaining an opportunity to grow your network and expose new people to your organization.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The first issue to take into account here is location, location, location. Think small and local. You have a much higher chance of success if you address a more focused, more motivated group of candidates during a smaller event. Attending larger events may raise awareness and prestige, but the audience may be from all over the continent. There’s not a lot of hope that you will find someone that fits your location.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Second, keep in mind that this recruitment tactic requires technical knowledge. You may turn to your CTO to help you here. Their combination of technical and business savvy gives them the right skillset to ensure an interesting conference presentation or practical workshop content.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Whenever you organize or participate in an event, you should think in terms of a recruitment funnel. You need enough people attending the event to sift out those that will be either uninterested or unqualified, and get the gems that you can hire.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Let’s dig a little deeper into how you can ensure success for each type of event.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **2 tips for effective conference presentations**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: When it comes to making an impact during a conference presentation, Wojciech shared with me two key nuggets of knowledge.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: His first piece of advice is simple: don’t be selfish! When preparing your content, you should ask yourself: **how will my audience benefit from attending my presentation?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Keep in mind that this is very different from looking into how you will benefit from making the presentation. That goal should not be your main focus; the attendants will catch on to it.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Wojciech’s second tip is much more specific and relates to live coding at conferences. Again, his answer is blunt: **just don’t do it.** Live demos during a presentation create a lot of problems for little to no benefit. Even if it’s smooth, it takes up way too much of your precious time. The audience is just watching you type!
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Additionally, it’s incredibly easy to make a mistake in your code and then waste even more time on debugging, hunting for that one mistyped line as your authority falters.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For those reasons, it’s much better to show ready-made code snippets and keep the show going smoothly.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Depending on the target audience you choose, you should also choose appropriate content. **Juniors** seek basic knowledge. They don’t want lectures or speeches; they’re mostly looking for knowledge akin to a programming course. **Advanced attendants** will be more interested in case studies of interesting projects. Make sure to present something concrete and focused.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The matter of junior vs advanced attendants also comes into play when you’re looking to organize a workshop.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Workshops: junior or advanced?**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Organizing a practical workshop yourself can be even more effective than attending a conference with your presentation. The downside, of course, is that it requires much more work and preparation involving many people in your organization. You are the host here, after all.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The most pivotal decision to make here is whether to gear your event towards juniors or more advanced developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.202Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It’s easier to conduct workshops for junior attendees - but do you want to recruit junior developers? Ask yourself th
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: is question in advance before you end up with an unproductive event.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: On the other hand, you can conduct advanced workshops. Keep in mind, however, that they are much more time-consuming to organize. You could spend many hours of work - even a whole month - preparing to pull of just one short event. Moreover, you’ll need to bring in experienced speakers and the audience will be harder to convince - both to attend and to take interest in your job offers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Filtering: when your workshop is a little too successful**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another issue to tackle with junior workshops is how you filter potential attendants. Usually your workshops will require at least a minimum of starting knowledge, even if they’re geared towards relative beginners.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: To process the influx of submissions and get worthwhile attendants, you need to establish an **automatic skills test**. Anything else will create too much work to process the event smoothly.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As an example, our Has Power workshops include a short, 4-question quiz. Attendants are invited based on their quiz answers and their LinkedIn profile. The need for careful selection is very real for us, since we usually have 2-3 people for each spot at workshops such as Python Has Power.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Hackathons: managing expectations**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another idea that has been gaining prominence among software houses and tech companies is organizing hackathons to attract programming talent.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The idea of a hackathon is quite simple. You book a venue. You order food and beverages for your attendants (beer is absolutely fine!). You invite potential candidates to participate in a fun coding project. Finally, you try to hire the ones that stand out the most.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hackathons work especially great if you’re a startup. You can even establish a theme for your hackathon such as VR, IoT, Big Data, AI - anything that’s exciting and fits your startup profile. Invite developers to come, code something, show off their idea and get prizes for the best projects. This way you can pre-select devs who have useful skills for your purposes.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You should keep in mind, however, that while hackathons can be easier to organize than workshops, they are also more expensive. Without an appropriate budget for food, drinks and prizes, you might fail to meet expectations.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: **your hackathon must be fun!** This type of event is all about creativity, so leave a lot of room for the attendants to run with their ideas. Don’t impose stiff limitations.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Oh, and one last thing. Don’t expect that people will come and create amazing software you can sell. The event shouldn’t support your product; it should bolster your recruitment. We’ve seen hackathons that were all about ‘cheap coding labor’ and rest assured, they are the very opposite of fun.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.203Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Summary**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One thing I can say for sure after my meeting with Wojciech is that recruiting developers is a deep subject. So deep, in fact, that it couldn’t possibly fit into one post. Which is why you can look forward to more in the near future!
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: And just because I know how busy you might be today, here’s a short recap of what we’ve covered so far:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **LinkedIn:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Your best bet to find good developers is probably still via direct LinkedIn outreach.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * A good outreach should be impressive and interesting. Put emphasis on your key advantages over the competition.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Information such as salary, location, tech stack and the next action to take are a must.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Conference presentations:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Prepare basic, course-like knowledge for junior attendants and case studies for advanced guests
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Think first about how the audience will benefit from seeing your presentation, not how you will benefit.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don’t do live coding - the risk of wasting your audience’s time is too great.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Workshops:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Keep in mind that a good workshop can take up to a month to organize properly.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * You should organize junior workshops only if you want junior developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Make sure to pre-filter your attendants using an automatic skills test.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: **Hackathons:**
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Make sure you have a budget that can support food, drinks and prizes for the attendants.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Feel free to give your hackathon a theme fitting your profile to attract the right programmers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don’t treat the hackathon as a source of free labor to build your product!
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Wow, even the recap got pretty long. All the more reason to revisit the subject very soon.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: *And that's the full body of the blog post (minus the obvious calls-to-action at the end). Hope you found it helpful. We ended up publishing a Part Two some time later, going into inbound recruitment methods. You can find a link in [the original blog post here](https://stxnext.com/blog/2017/08/16/ultimate-guide-hiring-high-impact-software-developers-part-one/).*

[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As a developer:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Put the salary range in your ads, don't waste my time. The same with the _real_ flexibility on location, working remotely, etc.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.204Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don't insist on a phone call just to describe the job which can be hard to schedule, just send an email regarding benefits, etc.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Interview (or send me the tests) straight away with those who make the actual decisions, so decisions can be made quickly
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don't waste time looking for references, if you really want them then ask for them on the first interview/contact. If you don't really need them (are they really trustworthy anyway?) then don't waste the time.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Try to make the interview problems constructive and interesting to discuss, I once had to just sit an hour long exam with no internet access, etc. and it was terrible and completely useless to judge and learn from.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Make any tests/exercises have a clear goal and set time. It sucks being asked to "deep dive" on a problem when I'm still working 50-55 hours a week and barely have time to get interviews, etc. arranged.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I've always had trouble with companies just delaying too much so I took other offers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do not promote the CEO or the company, why would I be interested if you have a A rated startup with a world level CEO but I am getting half of what I could get somewhere else with less stock options.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Start from how I will benefit from taking the job in short term and long term. Focus on what will be on the job offer not the future potentials.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Great Post! As a developer situated somewhere between the labels of junior and advanced I think it's worth noting that we "midrange" devs do exist and that both advanced course-like presentations and more accessible case studies will appeal to us, and, upon thinking further, to any dev. Learning and knowledge are spectra, are processes of becoming.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In general it would be wise to categorize developers with some more granularity than just "junior" and "advanced." At least one more level of categorization added to your planning can help make your events much more widely appealing and can attract the middle group of devs (presumably the largest group).
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hackathons must be fun! Not much to add here. I suppose it would be good to offer your tech stack as a template, perhaps provide a db of random tables that aren't necessarily restrictive creatively for devs to access, but then let the devs add to and subtract from the stack. Also, offer multiple categories of competition.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Linkedin messages can validate younger devs, while they may be seen as "just one more" in the ever-growing-stack-of-credit-card-applications inbox(500+) of a more experienced developer. Make sure all your messages have a personal touch, and even more so for more experienced devs.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Offer learning. Opportunities to augment the learning of current technologies and frameworks give you a unique competitive advantage! Though keep in mind that there are devs who are hungry learners (I know I am!), and there are devs who are not. Hire those who are hungry. If you're concerned about parsing the hungry learners from those who are not, just ask for code samples. The learners will undoubtedly have a trove of things they've been "just playing around with."
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 25% is 30k GBP in the UK? That would mean software dev salaries are at 120k. It's much more like 60k
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CC
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: O Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.205Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:35:22.206Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill

[2025-05-27T19:35:38.966Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:35:38.966Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is a mix of casual and informative. The initial bot message is formal and structured, aimed at providing guidelines and announcements. However, the subsequent comments reflect a more conversational and personal tone, particularly in expressions of regret or clarification about job roles.
[2025-05-27T19:35:38.966Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:35:38.966Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is predominantly straightforward and accessible, with some use of informal expressions. Phrases like "I wish I had learned earlier :')" convey a casual, relatable sentiment.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:35:56.414Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:35:56.414Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:56.414Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:56.414Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing som
[2025-05-27T19:35:56.415Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: e signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:35:56.415Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)

[2025-05-27T19:35:56.415Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:35:56.415Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:35:56.415Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.

These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:36:12.702Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone:**
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. There is a sense of frustration and incredulity regarding hiring practices, particularly concerning employee retention and compensation. The tone is somewhat **critical** of corporate policies, with an underlying sense of advocacy for better treatment of employees.
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.703Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns:**
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a mix of **casual language and rhetorical questions**, which engage readers and express the commenters' frustrations. Phrases like "why not just give them proper raises?" and "shouldn't that make you reconsider your hiring policies?" reflect a conversational style. There are also instances of **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "good candidates 'asked for too much'") and **abbreviations** (e.g., "esp." for especially), which contribute to the casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length:**
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.704Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, but they tend to be **moderate to long**, allowing for detailed explanations and personal anecdotes.

[2025-05-27T19:36:12.706Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone:**
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. There is a sense of frustration and incredulity regarding hiring practices, particularly concerning employee retention and compensation. The tone is somewhat **critical** of corporate policies, with an underlying sense of advocacy for better treatment of employees.
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns:**
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a mix of **casual language and rhetorical questions**, which engage readers and express the commenters' frustrations. Phrases like "why not just give them proper raises?" and "shouldn't that make you reconsider your hiring policies?" reflect a conversational style. There are also instances of **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "good candidates 'asked for too much'") and **abbreviations** (e.g., "esp." for especially), which contribute to the casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length:**
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, but they tend to be **moderate to long**, allowing for detailed explanations and personal anecdotes. This length provides enough space for the commenters to articulate their thoughts clearly and to elaborate on their experiences and opinions.

[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: If it's so expensive to hire new employees (esp. if someone leaves), why not just give them proper raises? Why is horizontal promotion the norm? Or why not offer better starting salaries?
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: At my last position, I was part of the interview process (doing the technical portions), but I was not unfortunately the one to ultimately decide if we went with a candidate. After months and months, I gathered we couldn't hire anyone because all the good candidates "asked for too much" (side note: shouldn't that make you, as a hiring manager, reconsider your hiring policies after a while?). Which is fine in itself, there are budget constraints, etc. But then I also learned we spent a lot on recruiting effort...so...why couldn't we take that money spent on recruiting effort to just up our offer?

[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: If it costs companies a lot to hire a software engineer.
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: .. then perhaps companies should focus more on retention.

[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can't _handle_ the best!
[2025-05-27T19:36:12.707Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: No, but seriously -- in the long run, the recruitment costs are going to be a small fraction of the total cost of an employee. The _best_ are expensive and, depending on what work you actually have for them to do, might not necessarily bring in significantly more money for you. If 95% of your software development is building CRUD-dy web-applications you won't get much extra juice out of the difference between "good" and "best." There's no point in paying extra to hire Green Berets when what you actually need is people to fill sandbags. (And while movies are all about the Green Berets and management consulting is all about hiring the best, in real life it's mostly sandbags and regular Joes.)

New CCO Vibe's great if you want fast and cheaper custom tools, tho you might miss the personal touch of traditional coding. some premium agencies are solid too but could be overkill for standard projects.

[2025-05-27T19:36:28.219Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.220Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. The users engage in a friendly manner, sharing experiences and advice without a sense of formality. There is a collaborative spirit as they aim to help one another navigate the challenges of small business and freelance hiring.
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.220Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.220Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward and accessible, often using **abbreviations** (e.g., "Fiverr," "r/smallbusiness") and **casual phrases** (e.g., "run the first project"). There are also instances of **direct address** (e.g., "you ask a question") that create a sense of dialogue. Some comments include **specific platform names** (e.g., Toptal, Braintrust) and **casual references** to experiences (e.g., "great," "trust each other more").
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.220Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.220Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, but most are **concise**, typically ranging from one to three sentences. This brevity reflects the platform's emphasis on quick exchanges of information and practical advice.
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.220Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.220Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is predominantly **casual**. While some comments are grammatically correct, others feature incomplete sentences or informal phrasing (e.g., "it depends on a developer position"). This casual approach aligns with the informal nature of Reddit discussions.

[2025-05-27T19:36:28.221Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. The users engage in a friendly manner, sharing experiences and advice without a sense of formality. There is a collaborative spirit as they aim to help one another navigate the challenges of small business and freelance hiring.
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward and accessible, often using **abbreviations** (e.g., "Fiverr," "r/smallbusiness") and **casual phrases** (e.g., "run the first project"). There are also instances of **direct address** (e.g., "you ask a question") that create a sense of dialogue. Some comments include **specific platform names** (e.g., Toptal, Braintrust) and **casual references** to experiences (e.g., "great," "trust each other more").
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, but most are **concise**, typically ranging from one to three sentences. This brevity reflects the platform's emphasis on quick exchanges of information and practical advice.
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is predominantly **casual**. While some comments are grammatically correct, others feature incomplete sentences or informal phrasing (e.g., "it depends on a developer position"). This casual approach aligns with the informal nature of Reddit discussions.

[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.224Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign

[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention

[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:36:28.225Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.373Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. Users express their thoughts candidly, often using personal anecdotes and experiences to illustrate their points. There is an underlying sense of **pragmatism**, especially in the comments discussing hiring practices and the realities of the tech industry. Some comments also carry a tone of **frustration** or **disappointment**, particularly regarding ageism and the challenges faced by junior developers.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly straightforward and accessible, with occasional use of **industry jargon** (e.g., "junior/mid level engineers," "grunt work," "senior SWE"). There are instances of **slang** and **abbreviations** (e.g., "SWE" for Software Engineer), which reflect a casual familiarity with the subject matter. The use of rhetorical questions (e.g., "Why do companies hire...") engages readers and encourages discussion. Some comments also include **personal anecdotes**, adding a narrative quality to the discourse.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.374Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, but they generally fall within a **medium range**. Some comments are concise, making quick points or observations, while others are more elaborate, providing detailed explanations or personal experiences. The longer comments often include multiple sentences and are structured to cover various aspects of the topic, while shorter comments may

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.375Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. Users express their thoughts candidly, often using personal anecdotes and experiences to illustrate their points. There is an underlying sense of **pragmatism**, especially in the comments discussing hiring practices and the realities of the tech industry. Some comments also carry a tone of **frustration** or **disappointment**, particularly regarding ageism and the challenges faced by junior developers.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly straightforward and accessible, with occasional use of **industry jargon** (e.g., "junior/mid level engineers," "grunt work," "senior SWE"). There are instances of **slang** and **abbreviations** (e.g., "SWE" for Software Engineer), which reflect a casual familiarity with the subject matter. The use of rhetorical questions (e.g., "Why do companies hire...") engages readers and encourages discussion. Some comments also include **personal anecdotes**, adding a narrative quality to the discourse.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, but they generally fall within a **medium range**. Some comments are concise, making quick points or observations, while others are more elaborate, providing detailed explanations or personal experiences. The longer comments often include multiple sentences and are structured to cover various aspects of the topic, while shorter comments may

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hey everyone, apologies for the silly question.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Junior dev here, was just looking at vacancies and I’ve realised some companies only hire senior engineers.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I mean, I get it - they want the most experienced people, which begs the question:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Why do companies hire junior/mid level engineers if they can just hire only senior engineers who can get the work done faster?
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thanks :)

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Seniors cost more money and are harder to hire, and not all work needs to be done ASAP.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: > Why do companies hire junior/mid level engineers if they can just hire only senior engineers who can get the work done faster?
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The primary reason I do it is to give my senior engineers leadership training.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ageism is real, and if you hit 50 and you've never led anything, people don't want to talk to you.  After 30 years of raises you're too expensive to be worth the money if I can't throw you on a project with a team of developers and expect you to deliver without my direct oversight.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As such, I have a responsibility to my senior developers, including those who are reluctant to take on any kind of leadership roles, to put them in charge of people who need mentoring and present management challenges.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The secondary reason is there is a lot of grunt work that must be done and that's what apprentices are for.  In a shop with only masters, someone has to sweep the shop floor and asking masters to do it is frankly insulting to their experience.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.376Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One management challenge is getting egotistical junior devs who think they should apply to senior level roles straight of college to pick up the broom and do the sweeping.

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.379Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Seniors aren’t always faster.  They are probably faster than nearly all juniors, but it’s a much closer race with mid levels.   The main difference is that seniors typically have a better understanding of the bigger picture, but as far as knocking out defined tickets a senior and mid level are close.

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.380Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention

[2025-05-27T19:36:44.381Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.382Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.382Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.382Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.382Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.382Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:36:44.382Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.137Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **cautionary and advisory**. The commenters express concern about the potential pitfalls of relying solely on junior developers for significant software projects. While some comments are more direct and critical, others adopt a more supportive and constructive approach, aiming to guide the original poster toward better decision-making.

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.137Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is mostly **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. Commenters often employ phrases like "please man" and "don't make this mistake," which adds a personal touch.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.137Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "Jira," "architect/senior engineer," "technical debt") and **everyday language**, making the comments accessible to a broader audience while still addressing specific technical concerns.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.137Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments contain rhetorical questions (e.g., "Think you and a couple junior engineers can pull off building a legit car?") to provoke thought and emphasize points.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Bear with me, I know the answer might be obvious to some of you, but let me give you some context.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm currently developing a software. I have a big idea, and want to see it happen. I already made the decision that it will be very hard, expensive, time consuming and error prone to do it all with outsourced developers, so I decided to hire one or two junior developers (all I can afford at the moment).
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Given that I will have limited experience, my rational at the moment is: I should hire an experienced software architect and/or engineer along with a experienced database designer to lay the foundation of the project: design the APIs, design the database, design the folder structure, eventually what part of the project will be based on microservices, how the infrastructure will work, basically, all of the "structural" part of the software. I know all of those topics are pretty dynamic, but I also have the impression that with a good design from the beginning I could work on a more solid "kernel".
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: With that in hand, my idea is that I could make a fairly detailed "to do" list, with fairly detailed product requirements (I already have the UX/UI in hand, as well as the specifics on how to software should function), think of Jira epics and stories. With all that information, I'm thinking it would be easier (not easy, just easier) to manage the less experienced developers, something like a "fill in the blanks" logic (theres this API path, that behaves this way, and have to give this JSON as an output). I know it sounds too simplistic in a two paragraph post, but I think it gives an idea of how I'm trying to achieve my goal.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What do you guys think? Does it make sense? What other approaches could I think of, given that I (for now) won't be able to have a full blown technology team? I'm fairly familiar with the topics involved, do  some coding myself, and I believe I would be able to understand the trade-offs involved during the design phase, and make the required decisions.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Any help would be appreciated.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thanks a bunch.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: You hired 2 juniors instead of 1 medium or senior, and you expect you can manage them with detailed jira board/stories?
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: *Short answer: forget it!*
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You may ask "why". So, you'll create detailed stories (you think they are detailed) but missing point of view of exp dev for sure you'll make (some) mistakes.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Even if you assume your Jira will be tip-top, then how you make sure (being not technical expert) that the implementation by 2 junior devs is good? Probably you won't.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: After few weeks, adding new features will take you weeks, instead of days - and that's the point when you'll start wasting money (actually time, but time is money) fast.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Please man, don't make this mistake, for your own sake.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Let's make this real simple. Imagine this product you're looking to build is a car. You know the kind of car you want to build. You know the different features you want, in a pretty detailed way. And you've even worked on some cars before.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Think you and a couple junior engineers can pull off building a legit car? To sell to people? That meets legal requirements and can drive on the freeway?
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Honestly this is more of a business question than anything.  From a pure technology standpoint, yes you always want an architect/senior engineer that can manage a new product in the early stages of development, but the real question is do you have the investment capital and a good enough expected ROI early on to handle this type of investment?  It will likely slow your go to market down some as building it 'the right way' up front takes extra time and obviously costs more, but if you are confident and have the time/money it will save you a lot of headaches in the round B/C part of the business' lifecycle.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Assuming the technology is as complicated as you are implying, you may see a greater benefit than most start ups as well, which should be weighed in your decision making process.  Good luck to you man, hopefully we'll hear about a new power house company in a few years!

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Business Context: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Community Tone Analysis:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **cautionary and advisory**. The commenters express concern about the potential pitfalls of relying solely on junior developers for significant software projects. While some comments are more direct and critical, others adopt a more supportive and constructive approach, aiming to guide the original poster toward better decision-making.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is mostly **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. Commenters often employ phrases like "please man" and "don't make this mistake," which adds a personal touch.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "Jira," "architect/senior engineer," "technical debt") and **everyday language**, making the comments accessible to a broader audience while still addressing specific technical concerns.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments contain rhetorical questions (e.g., "Think you and a couple junior engineers can pull off building a legit car?") to provoke thought and emphasize points.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.139Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being quite **concise** (1-2 sentences) while others are more **elaborate** (several paragraphs). The longer comments tend to provide detailed explanations or personal anecdotes to support their advice.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**. While most comments are coherent and structured
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Does it make sense to hire a experienced software architect?
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Bear with me, I know the answer might be obvious to some of you, but let me give you some context.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm currently developing a software. I have a big idea, and want to see it happen. I already made the decision that it will be very hard, expensive, time consuming and error prone to do it all with outsourced developers, so I decided to hire one or two junior developers (all I can afford at the moment).
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Given that I will have limited experience, my rational at the moment is: I should hire an experienced software architect and/or engineer along with a experienced database designer to lay the foundation of the project: design the APIs, design the database, design the folder structure, eventually what part of the project will be based on microservices, how the infrastructure will work, basically, all of the "structural" part of the software. I know all of those topics are pretty dynamic, but I also have the impression that with a good design from the beginning I could work on a more solid "kernel".
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: With that in hand, my idea is that I could make a fairly detailed "to do" list, with fairly detailed product requirements (I already have the UX/UI in hand, as well as the specifics on how to software should function), think of Jira epics and stories. With all that information, I'm thinking it would be easier (not easy, just easier) to manage the less experienced developers, something like a "fill in the blanks" logic (theres this API path, that behaves this way, and have to give this JSON as an output). I know it sounds too simplistic in a two paragraph post, but I think it gives an idea of how I'm trying to achieve my goal.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What do you guys think? Does it make sense? What other approaches could I think of, given that I (for now) won't be able to have a full blown technology team? I'm fairly familiar with the topics involved, do  some coding myself, and I believe I would be able to understand the trade-offs involved during the design phase, and make the required decisions.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Any help would be appreciated.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thanks a bunch.

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You hired 2 juniors instead of 1 medium or senior, and you expect you can manage them with detailed jira board/stories?
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: *Short answer: forget it!*
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You may ask "why". So, you'll create detailed stories (you think they are detailed) but missing point of view of exp dev for sure you'll make (some) mistakes.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Even if you assume your Jira will be tip-top, then how you make sure (being not technical expert) that the implementation by 2 junior devs is good? Probably you won't.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: After few weeks, adding new features will take you weeks, instead of days - and that's the point when you'll start wasting money (actually time, but time is money) fast.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Please man, don't make this mistake, for your own sake.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Let's make this real simple. Imagine this product you're looking to build is a car. You know the kind of car you want to build. You know the different features you want, in a pretty detailed way. And you've even worked on some cars before.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Think you and a couple junior engineers can pull off building a legit car? To sell to people? That meets legal requirements and can drive on the freeway?
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Honestly this is more of a business question than anything.  From a pure technology standpoint, yes you always want an architect/senior engineer that can manage a new product in the early stages of development, but the real question is do you have the investment capital and a good enough expected ROI early on to handle this type of investment?  It will likely slow your go to market down some as building it 'the right way' up front takes extra time and obviously costs more, but if you are confident and have the time/money it will save you a lot of headaches in the round B/C part of the business' lifecycle.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Assuming the technology is as complicated as you are implying, you may see a greater benefit than most start ups as well, which should be weighed in your decision making process.  Good luck to you man, hopefully we'll hear about a new power house company in a few years!

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.140Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Please don't start any significant new software project just with junior developers, this is how messy/unmaintainable and plain wrong and unsecure code is being created.

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)

[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:37:04.141Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k.

That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:37:39.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:37:39.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:39.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly serious and analytical. Users are discussing economic and employment trends in the tech industry, reflecting concern and frustration over job losses and hiring practices. There is a sense of urgency in the discussions, particularly regarding the impact of AI and overseas hiring on domestic job markets. While some comments contain a hint of conspiracy or skepticism (e.g., references to "elites"), the majority focus on factual observations and economic reasoning.
[2025-05-27T19:37:39.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:39.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly straightforward and technical, with some users employing industry-specific jargon (e.g., "labor costs," "return on investment," "junior overseas developers"). There is minimal use of slang or abbreviations, which is typical for discussions that aim to convey complex ideas clearly. However, some comments do use informal phrases (e.g., "yachts full of money") that add a conversational touch. The use of phrases like "it's actually because" indicates a desire to assert a point of view or clarify misconceptions.
[2025-05-27T19:37:39.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:39.695Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, but they tend to be relatively long, often consisting of several sentences or even paragraphs. This length allows users to elaborate on their points, provide context, and engage with the topic in depth. The longer comments often contain multiple ideas or observations, reflecting a thorough consideration of the subject matter.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:37:46.598Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-RESULT] Verbose Comment: oh man i feel you on this one. i've used free tools like github copilot to get by, but they really can't handle big projects or specific business needs. then i found new cco vibe, they use ai to code fast and cheap, which is awesome if you're on a budget. downside is, you'll need to be patient with ai's quirks sometimes. for premium solutions, hiring elite us-based devs is great if you have the budget, but it's not always necessary unless your project is super complex. lmk if you want more details!

[2025-05-27T19:37:58.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the first two comments is **informative and somewhat professional**, with a focus on providing practical advice. The use of phrases like "Best of luck with it!" adds a touch of encouragement. The third comment, however, shifts to a **more casual and informal tone**, especially with the phrase "I'll make app for free bro," which conveys a friendly and approachable demeanor.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The first two comments utilize **technical jargon** related to app development (e.g., "devops," "portfolio," "copycats"), indicating a knowledgeable audience. They also employ a structured, methodical approach to advice-giving. In contrast, the third comment uses **slang** ("bro") and lacks technical language, making it more relatable and informal.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.567Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The first two comments are **relatively long and detailed**, providing multiple points and recommendations. They are structured in a way that suggests a thorough understanding of the topic. The third comment is **very short**, consisting of a single sentence, which reflects a more casual engagement style typical of informal conversations.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.568Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The first two comments exhibit a **more polished grammar style**, with complete sentences and proper punctuation. They reflect a formal writing style appropriate for professional advice. The third comment, however, is **casual and less formal**, using a conversational

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:37:58.570Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.570Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the first two comments is **informative and somewhat professional**, with a focus on providing practical advice. The use of phrases like "Best of luck with it!" adds a touch of encouragement. The third comment, however, shifts to a **more casual and informal tone**, especially with the phrase "I'll make app for free bro," which conveys a friendly and approachable demeanor.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.570Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.570Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The first two comments utilize **technical jargon** related to app development (e.g., "devops," "portfolio," "copycats"), indicating a knowledgeable audience. They also employ a structured, methodical approach to advice-giving. In contrast, the third comment uses **slang** ("bro") and lacks technical language, making it more relatable and informal.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.570Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.570Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The first two comments are **relatively long and detailed**, providing multiple points and recommendations. They are structured in a way that suggests a thorough understanding of the topic. The third comment is **very short**, consisting of a single sentence, which reflects a more casual engagement style typical of informal conversations.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.570Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The first two comments exhibit a **more polished grammar style**, with complete sentences and proper punctuation.

[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Wanting advice. I'm not even sure if this is the right place to post.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I have an idea for an a business app, to help farmers, that I would like to make into reality. But I have absolutely no software/app development skills.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: How would one go about hiring someone to develop an app?
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Where do you find companies that make this stuff? What sort of fees do they usually charge? Or is it usually a percentage of sales?
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What are some important things to be aware of to make sure I don't get scammed or my idea stolen?
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Where should I start?

[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: If you want someone local to you then try networking events to find a software agency. If you want to find a remote team then you can have a look online. Most apps need input from designers, developers, devops and testers. The actual labour requirements depend on the complexity of the app. But you should be able to find an agency that does all of that in house.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The cost will be high. Most places won’t work on a percentage of sales. You’d be looking at 5 figures for an app as a minimum. If you cheap out, you’ll suffer down the road. I would recommend creating a solid business plan and raising capital. If you struggle to raise the capital take it as a sign!
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.571Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Best of luck with it!
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.573Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: 1. write out your idea in long form and send it to 25 friends and 25 farmers for feedback on if anyone would use it. There can be good ideas that have no market, for example. You want people to play devil's advocate so you can decide if this is worth pursuing
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.573Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. if you have a small budget, use websites like upwork fiverr and freelancer and you can hire talent in eg. colombia, nigeria or the phillipines to build it (take note, there are a lot of insufficiently educated and trained people out there in the rest of the world so look for degrees (sure there are talented dropouts but more untalented ones. a formal education helps you learn something the right way and this is worth screening for if going international) and look for portfolio. You can pay a flat rate or hourly. Perhaps start hourly to see if you like working with the person. (before hiring talent hire a consultant from the same websites to get a more indepth answer than here for your project. Heck, you could also hire a project manager. Welcome to the era of remote work. The whole world is ready to work for you)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.573Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. hard to avoid copycats. Grow quickly. Save some features for version 2.0 and 3.0 so they don't copy your whole thing at launch. The original company that builds an idea usually seems to last long term... for some market share at least.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.573Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. the accountability that those websites provide goes a long way to preventing being scammed. (if you just google companies in some foreign country and send a whatsapp message, different story). However, someone not bringing the quality they promised is possible. When I hire, I like to do a lot of discussion over video calls. Easier to spot redflags. My rule is if everything is green flag green flag green flag then we are good. If it's below this standard, as Bob Dylan says "if something's not right it's wrong" (get a bad feeling? bail)

[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.576Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)

[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:

[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:37:58.577Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2.

[2025-05-27T19:38:18.520Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.520Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone:**
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.521Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly critical and assertive, with a hint of frustration directed towards the idea of paying $30 an hour for software development. The comments convey a sense of disbelief and disapproval regarding the undervaluation of skilled labor. Some comments adopt a more casual and conversational tone, while others are more direct and confrontational.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.521Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns:**
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.521Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments utilize straightforward language with minimal jargon, making them accessible to a broad audience. There is a mix of formal and informal expressions. Phrases like "dirt cheap" and "don't be a dick man" reflect a casual, conversational style, while others use more formal structures, such as "access to the internet" and "demand a higher price." The use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios also adds to the conversational flow.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.521Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length:**
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.521Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being concise (e.g., "Dont be a dick man just pay up") and others being more elaborate and detailed (e.g., the second comment outlining the consequences of hiring inexperienced developers). This variation suggests that commenters adjust their length based on the complexity of their points or the seriousness of the discussion.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.521Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style:**
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.521Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is mostly casual, with some comments containing grammatical errors or informal constructions (e.g., "somone" instead of "someone," "

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone:**
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly critical and assertive, with a hint of frustration directed towards the idea of paying $30 an hour for software development. The comments convey a sense of disbelief and disapproval regarding the undervaluation of skilled labor. Some comments adopt a more casual and conversational tone, while others are more direct and confrontational.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns:**
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments utilize straightforward language with minimal jargon, making them accessible to a broad audience. There is a mix of formal and informal expressions. Phrases like "dirt cheap" and "don't be a dick man" reflect a casual, conversational style, while others use more formal structures, such as "access to the internet" and "demand a higher price." The use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios also adds to the conversational flow.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length:**
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being concise (e.g., "Dont be a dick man just pay up") and others being more elaborate and detailed (e.g., the second comment outlining the consequences of hiring inexperienced developers). This variation suggests that commenters adjust their length based on the complexity of their points or the seriousness of the discussion.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style:**
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is mostly casual, with some comments containing grammatical errors or informal constructions (e.g., "somone" instead of "someone," "

[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Even in a developing nation somone with the kind of skillset you are looking for is going to have access to the internet, access to technology and education. This means they are going to demand a higher price than someone stitching soccerballs and they are going to have access to more alternatives.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you are looking for cheap, you found it at $30/hour.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.523Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: You could try seeking out uninformed and inexperienced developers who are just starting out and don't know the value of their work, exploit their work for less than market rate, convince them that they're worthless so they won't quit, but achieve sloppy work from inexperienced and stressed workers, and ultimately get a project that doesn't accomplish your goals. The end result will be a failed project, a failed startup based on whatever your project was meant to support, the costs of whatever you paid your engineers, and all other business costs you sunk into this gamble.
[2025-05-27T19:38:18.524Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Best of luck!

However, the user's focus is on extremely low hourly rates, which is a bit different from what New CCO Vibe offers, as they provide cost-effective full solutions rather than hourly rates. There's an indirect expression of need for affordable solutions, making it a moderate match.

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: Based on the provided Reddit comments, here’s an analysis of the overall tone, language patterns, and other stylistic elements:
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.222Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.223Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Professional and Direct**: The comments convey a professional tone, particularly in the context of discussing startup ideas and software development. The users are straightforward and candid about their expectations and experiences.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.223Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Cynical and Critical**: There is a noticeable skepticism towards startup ideas, with some comments expressing frustration about the quality of proposals received. Phrases like "99% of ideas are shit" illustrate a blunt, critical attitude.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.223Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Instructive and Advisory**: Many comments take on an advisory role, offering practical advice to those looking to approach developers or investors. This is evident in the structured recommendations and "do's and don'ts" format used by some commenters.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.223Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.223Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Technical Jargon**: The comments include industry-specific terminology related to software development (e.g., "MVP," "tech stack," "iterative processes"), indicating that the audience is familiar with these concepts.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.223Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Direct Address and Imperatives**: Many comments use direct address ("If I were you," "Do not expect") and imperative statements, which create a sense of urgency and authority in the advice being given.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.223Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Colloquial Language**: While the tone is professional, there are instances of colloquial expressions (e.g., "huge red flag," "cheap offshoring always

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Based on the provided Reddit comments, here’s an analysis of the overall tone, language patterns, and other stylistic elements:
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Professional and Direct**: The comments convey a professional tone, particularly in the context of discussing startup ideas and software development. The users are straightforward and candid about their expectations and experiences.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Cynical and Critical**: There is a noticeable skepticism towards startup ideas, with some comments expressing frustration about the quality of proposals received. Phrases like "99% of ideas are shit" illustrate a blunt, critical attitude.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Instructive and Advisory**: Many comments take on an advisory role, offering practical advice to those looking to approach developers or investors. This is evident in the structured recommendations and "do's and don'ts" format used by some commenters.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Technical Jargon**: The comments include industry-specific terminology related to software development (e.g., "MVP," "tech stack," "iterative processes"), indicating that the audience is familiar with these concepts.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Direct Address and Imperatives**: Many comments use direct address ("If I were you," "Do not expect") and imperative statements, which create a sense of urgency and authority in the advice being given.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Colloquial Language**: While the tone is professional, there are instances of colloquial expressions (e.g., "huge red flag," "cheap offshoring always

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Lately, we have been discussing non-stop about an idea for a startup, that we very firmly believe in, and we are ready to invest every penny we made in the past.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: We would like to get our idea to a somewhat working product before we apply for funding
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Since we are not that tech savvy when it comes to coding, our biggest concern is, how do we hire/find programmers who would either like to join us (another co-founder is a possibility), or hire him full time to work on the project.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Programmers, coders, how would you like to be approached when it comes to such situations?
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TL;DR - We have a startup idea and a small budget, how do we find programmers for it?
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit: Budget is around $10k

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I get approached quite often on linked in. The issue is - 99% of ideas are shit, have no chance of competing or I don't trust the person i'm talking to.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If I were you - get a freelancer, build a MVP, get investment and hire people. If you can convince an investor then you'll usually be able to convince other people your idea is a go.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Your job is to sell me the project and the vision.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.227Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you cant sell your product and vision to your team. How are you going to sell it to the public or VC’s?

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I was recently approached by a startup and agreed to join because it allows me to combine development with another interest (my background is in the music industry prior to getting into tech, and this company is in that space). Also, as a developer, it was appealing that they had decided to use a really cool tech stack, and the project requires us to solve interesting problems.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit: Point being, developers often have enough options to be picky. If your startup scratches some itch, in the subject matter, the technology used, or the type of problems that need to be solved, good devs will be a lot more likely to consider joining you, and perhaps be willing to work for a bit less than market, at least in the early stages.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.231Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: a. Huge red flag.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Don’t assume they are a him.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do try to learn about software engineering and how it is very different from any kind of static asset creation. It’s not like lego blocks or building a house from a blueprint. More like composing music or painting, it’s not a linear progress bar of doneness.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do learn that less is more and avoid piling on too many speculative features. Figure out the smallest possible feature set with no bells and whistles and just make that a perfect user experience first. Once you have users it will become easier to know what to build next.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do learn about iterative processes. The best way to succeed in software is to understand that if you want a fixed high level of quality and to keep timelines, the number one safe variable to manipulate is scope, so find ways of reducing it at every turn in order to de-risk.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do pay market rates. Cheap offshoring always fails. Expect to rewrite the entire codebase several times if you go down that route.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do not expect over time and heroic dedication just because you can think of exciting ideas for 23 hours a day. Programming requires a deep state of flow and uses much more energy than other kinds of mental work. If you expect them to perform like a cofounder then they need to have enough equity to make that realistic. But equity is worth nothing until they have created the product for you, so protect their health and work-life balance like it’s the only asset you have, because it is.
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do understand that every single meeting or phone call literally subtracts from productive engineering time. Attention is a finite  and precious resource and should not be used up frivolously. It takes hours to context switch from extroverted meeting mode to introverted flow mode. Each interruption just delays timelines by the length of the interruption plus a tax of several hours. Asking for progress updates until a pre-agreed deadline is a fools errand.

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.232Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:38:36.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)

[2025-05-27T19:38:36.233Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)

These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:38:56.269Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments varies significantly. The first few comments exhibit a **professional and inquisitive tone**, as users ask thoughtful questions aimed at gaining insights into hiring practices. The tone is respectful and constructive, reflecting a desire for guidance and information.
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.269Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - In contrast, the fourth comment takes on a **frustrated and cynical tone**.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:38:56.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:38:56.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

My background is more on the business side and I know next to nothing about engineering. Can anyone recommend how I might go about defining the right type of engineer for what I want to build, and then any resources for finding those folks to hire, ideally on a part time or contract basis? Thank you!

[2025-05-27T19:39:13.428Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: If you know nothing you can be taken for a ride. The kind of code and engineering you need to build for a one person shop or for a ten person shop or for a non-technical company is totally different than for a large corporate employer for example. For your case continuity of business and documentation will be extremely important as well speed onboarding new developers but to get someone who actually cares about that will be a miracle since most people don't.
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.428Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ideally you have an experienced and highly invested technical cofounder. If you don't -- good luck.

[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.431Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.432Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.432Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:39:13.432Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:39:29.301Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.301Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.301Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.301Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.301Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:39:29.302Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:39:51.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:40:07.938Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.939Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.939Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **casual** and **conversational**, with elements of **frustration** and **humor**. The use of exclamation marks and informal expressions conveys a laid-back atmosphere, while the discussions about job market challenges and interview experiences introduce a sense of exasperation.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.939Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.939Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a mix of **slang** and **abbreviations** (e.g., "prolapse," "O(log n)," "SWEs" for software engineers, "FE" for front-end). The use of phrases like "it sucks" and "wild how many low level candidates" reflects a colloquial style. Additionally, there are instances of **internet slang** (e.g., "lmao," "where the fuck are you people?") that emphasize emotional reactions.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.939Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.939Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, but they tend to be **medium to long**, allowing for detailed explanations and personal anecdotes. This length enables users to express their thoughts thoroughly, particularly when discussing complex topics like job interviews and market conditions.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.939Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.939Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar is generally **casual**, with instances of incomplete sentences and informal punctuation (e.g., excessive use of exclamation marks, lack of capitalization in some cases). This reflects a conversational tone rather than a formal writing style

[2025-05-27T19:40:07.940Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:40:07.941Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Fake resumes: the amount of people who lie on their resumes is insane, not only about the technologies they used but also about their work experience and education. It makes it harder for real applicants to get noticed and it makes it harder for us to hire them…
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.941Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Unable to answer basic questions: don’t say you have implemented technology X if you can’t tell me what the fuck you did with technology X. It’s fine if you don’t know the details of technology X, but tell me how you interacted with it.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.941Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. (This one is for the companies hiring) stop pushing candidates to be competitive code gamers like leetcoders, it’s a useless fucking skill and I don’t need a kid that knows how to prolapse a banana tree in O(n) time, I need someone that can design, implement and document and API.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.941Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. Reading from a text during non technical interviews, we can tell you a googling stuff, the screen light on your face is changing, you look stupid, stop it. Story: we had one dude act like the video call was frozen and would just sit there without moving but we could see the reflection of the screen in his glasses change as he was googling answers to our basic questions.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.941Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. If you are struggling in a technical interview, that’s fine, the best thing you can do is talk, talk about what you don’t understand, what you think could work, why you expected you code to work etc, also I think it’s perfectly normal to use google while sharing your screen in a technical interview, if they allow you to, please show them your googling and documentation reading skills, those are also part of the interview.

[2025-05-27T19:40:07.941Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: This is awesome!!! Also I can prolapse a banana tree in O(log n) so you should hire me!
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.941Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: For point 2 I think a lot of the reason is because companies are asking for everything under the sun. I got recently rejected because out of the 15 technologies they used I didn’t have terraform on it. Our projects used terraform, I just never interacted with it. I can see why people start putting technologies in their resume they have maybe 5 minutes of experience with. It sucks.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.942Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: You’ve hit on a few big negatives of bad job markets for employers.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.942Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most SWEs avoid looking for a job if they have any choice.  So, employers don’t get to choose from all SWEs, just SWEs with no other choice.  Lots of good SWEs will just wait out the market and won’t risk a new job.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.942Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A lot of employers have so many candidates that they seem to filter for the most desperate candidates instead of the best employee.  OAs are interesting in this way: some SWEs do OAs and some don’t but SWEs who don’t do OAs aren’t provably worse SWEs than those that do.  Similar, SWEs who are willing to do a 12-loop interview.  Employers end up choosing the best SWE from a group of very desperate SWEs.

If you are struggling in a technical interview, that’s fine, the best thing you can do is talk, talk about what you don’t understand, what you think could work, why you expected you code to work etc, also I think it’s perfectly normal to use google while sharing your screen in a technical interview, if they allow you to, please show them your googling and documentation reading skills, those are also part of the interview.

[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is awesome!!! Also I can prolapse a banana tree in O(log n) so you should hire me!
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For point 2 I think a lot of the reason is because companies are asking for everything under the sun. I got recently rejected because out of the 15 technologies they used I didn’t have terraform on it. Our projects used terraform, I just never interacted with it. I can see why people start putting technologies in their resume they have maybe 5 minutes of experience with. It sucks.

[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You’ve hit on a few big negatives of bad job markets for employers.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most SWEs avoid looking for a job if they have any choice.  So, employers don’t get to choose from all SWEs, just SWEs with no other choice.  Lots of good SWEs will just wait out the market and won’t risk a new job.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A lot of employers have so many candidates that they seem to filter for the most desperate candidates instead of the best employee.  OAs are interesting in this way: some SWEs do OAs and some don’t but SWEs who don’t do OAs aren’t provably worse SWEs than those that do.  Similar, SWEs who are willing to do a 12-loop interview.  Employers end up choosing the best SWE from a group of very desperate SWEs.

[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: While you get scammers that can't white a for loop. Should I start lying on my resume just to get to the table?
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.944Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:40:07.945Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Three years ago, I took a job in the UK, later transitioned to contracting for a US company, and eventually returned to Tunisia with a goal: building [Carthage Software Cooperative](https://carthage.software)—a consultancy focused on connecting highly skilled engineers with complex technical challenges. After starting legal paperwork and launching our [first job ad](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4184020927), we’ve reviewed 100+ applicants. Sadly, none met the bar. Here’s what I’ve observed, along with advice for engineers looking to level up.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # The Hiring Reality Check:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Skill Gaps**: Many applicants with 10-20+ years of experience only listed CRUD apps, API integrations, and basic frontend work. None demonstrated deep systems knowledge (e.g., compilers, static analysis, low-level tooling). Résumés often lacked evidence of **problem-solving beyond frameworks**.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Honesty Issues**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. 80% claimed Rust experience, but couldn’t explain basic ownership concepts.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. 90% mentioned "static analysis," but equated it to running `tsc`—not building tools.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. Many misrepresented English fluency (e.g., 50% answered `"Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status?"` with `yes` while being tunisian citizens?).
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **The Learning Stagnation Problem**: Too few engineers pursue intellectual curiosity outside their jobs. If your entire skillset is tied to workplace tasks, you’ll plateau.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # Advice for Aspiring Engineers:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Dig Deeper Than Frameworks**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Learn how tools work under the hood. Build a simple HTTP router, write a parser, or create a game. These projects force you to understand concepts, not just APIs.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Explore niches: Compilers, distributed systems, formal methods. These areas are underrepresented here but highly valued globally.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Be Honest (It’s Obvious)**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you list Rust on your résumé, expect to answer: “Explain the borrow checker” or “How would you optimize this unsafe block?”
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you claim expertise in static analysis, be ready to discuss abstract syntax trees or dataflow analysis.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Misrepresentation burns bridges. Tunisia’s tech community is small.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Master English**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * 95% of cutting-edge resources (docs, research papers, tutorials) are in English.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Practice technical writing: Contribute to open-source docs, write blog posts, or summarize papers.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Build for Learning, Not Just Résumés**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Reinvent wheels: A custom database, OS, or programming language teaches more than any tutorial.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.886Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Open-source contributions matter. Even small fixes to open source projects show initi
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ative.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **Network Strategically**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Engage with global communities (Discord, GitHub, niche forums). Local meetups are great, but don’t limit yourself.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Follow engineers working on hard problems—not just influencers posting career hacks.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 6. **Aim for Mastery, Not Titles**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Senior != years worked. It’s about solving ambiguous problems, mentoring others, and owning systems end-to-end.

[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: We’re still hiring for Senior Software Engineers. If you’re passionate about systems programming, compilers, or reimagining developer tooling, you’ll be working directly on [**Mago**](https://github.com/carthage-software/mago)—a PHP toolchain written entirely in Rust. This isn’t just “another framework.” It’s a deep dive into static analysis, performance optimization, and rethinking how developers interact with PHP ecosystems.

[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: You're being very unrealistic.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overlap of skills and knowledge you're looking for is extremely rare globally let alone Tunisia. You're looking for a senior dev with expertise in Rust, PHP and static analysis. I think I can safely say there isn't a single engineer in Tunisia that qualifies. Your best bet is to find some really promising junior engineers, train them on the job and hope they don't leave by the time you're productive.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As for the knowledge and skill level of senior devs in Tunisia most developers are going to get as good as the job requires them to be. This isn't unique to Tunisia the main difference being most SWE jobs here just call for CRUD apps. No one is coming to Tunisia to hire people to work on parsers or compilers, they're hiring people to work on web apps built in Java or PHP or JS.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Totally agree with you. The problem is that most of the time, companies don't care how intelligent or curious you are, they just want someone that is familiar with their stack. The truth is, if you need to find a job as soon as possible, it's better to be a "frameworker".
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is my opinion based on my experience, (software) engineering schools in Tunisia suck ass. Students will claim they know C++ after doing some movie management project (or something like that) for class and put it on their CV, but they don't even know what RAII and smart pointers are. I know because I've been there and did that. But I guess it's okay, these are just students, but you claim there are people like this with multiple years of experience, which is much worse.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Honestly, I would've been a much better software engineer if I spent 5 years after my bac learning and building stuff that interests me instead of having to go through 2 years of bullshit prepa and 3 years of attending boring lectures. But I don't regret it because I'm very happy and proud of what I'm doing now and I wouldn't have been here without all that bullshit.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.887Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I m a software engineer with 4 yoe and here s my take on the hiring process. I ve worked on multiple projects from banking to construction. And it all drops down to unserstanding the project. Sure ur technichal skills help at resolving problems and finding solutions but, the more u work on the project the more u understand it and the more u can optimize it. What baffels me is the recruiting process. I get asked about complicated things in depth analysis or resolving tree data structures and let me tell u that i ve never used my knowledge beyond the recruitment process. In the end it s the same code just just different architecture and file names. In my opinion it s better to find some 1 motivated eager to learn more than some 1 specific with the skills u want because u can lean those skills along the way while working on the project.

They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k.

[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Hiring Challenges & Advice for Tunisian Software Engineers
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Three years ago, I took a job in the UK, later transitioned to contracting for a US company, and eventually returned to Tunisia with a goal: building [Carthage Software Cooperative](https://carthage.software)—a consultancy focused on connecting highly skilled engineers with complex technical challenges. After starting legal paperwork and launching our [first job ad](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4184020927), we’ve reviewed 100+ applicants. Sadly, none met the bar. Here’s what I’ve observed, along with advice for engineers looking to level up.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # The Hiring Reality Check:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Skill Gaps**: Many applicants with 10-20+ years of experience only listed CRUD apps, API integrations, and basic frontend work. None demonstrated deep systems knowledge (e.g., compilers, static analysis, low-level tooling). Résumés often lacked evidence of **problem-solving beyond frameworks**.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Honesty Issues**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. 80% claimed Rust experience, but couldn’t explain basic ownership concepts.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. 90% mentioned "static analysis," but equated it to running `tsc`—not building tools.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. Many misrepresented English fluency (e.g., 50% answered `"Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status?"` with `yes` while being tunisian citizens?).
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **The Learning Stagnation Problem**: Too few engineers pursue intellectual curiosity outside their jobs. If your entire skillset is tied to workplace tasks, you’ll plateau.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # Advice for Aspiring Engineers:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Dig Deeper Than Frameworks**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Learn how tools work under the hood. Build a simple HTTP router, write a parser, or create a game. These projects force you to understand concepts, not just APIs.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.889Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Explore niches: Compilers, distributed systems, formal methods. These areas are underrepresented here but highly valued globally.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Be Honest (It’s Obvious)**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you list Rust on your résumé, expect to answer: “Explain the borrow checker” or “How would you optimize this unsafe block?”
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you claim expertise in static analysis, be ready to discuss abstract syntax trees or dataflow analysis.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Misrepresentation burns bridges. Tunisia’s tech community is small.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Master English**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * 95% of cutting-edge resources (docs, research papers, tutorials) are in English.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Practice technical writing: Contribute to open-source docs, write blog posts, or summarize papers.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Build for Learning, Not Just Résumés**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Reinvent wheels: A custom database, OS, or programming language teaches more than any tutorial.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Open-source contributions matter. Even small fixes to open source projects show initiative.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **Network Strategically**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Engage with global communities (Discord, GitHub, niche forums). Local meetups are great, but don’t limit yourself.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Follow engineers working on hard problems—not just influencers posting career hacks.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 6. **Aim for Mastery, Not Titles**:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Senior != years worked. It’s about solving ambiguous problems, mentoring others, and owning systems end-to-end.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: # To Those Still Interested:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: We’re still hiring for Senior Software Engineers. If you’re passionate about systems programming, compilers, or reimagining developer tooling, you’ll be working directly on [**Mago**](https://github.com/carthage-software/mago)—a PHP toolchain written entirely in Rust. This isn’t just “another framework.” It’s a deep dive into static analysis, performance optimization, and rethinking how developers interact with PHP ecosystems.

[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You're being very unrealistic.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overlap of skills and knowledge you're looking for is extremely rare globally let alone Tunisia. You're looking for a senior dev with expertise in Rust, PHP and static analysis. I think I can safely say there isn't a single engineer in Tunisia that qualifies. Your best bet is to find some really promising junior engineers, train them on the job and hope they don't leave by the time you're productive.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As for the knowledge and skill level of senior devs in Tunisia most developers are going to get as good as the job requires them to be. This isn't unique to Tunisia the main difference being most SWE jobs here just call for CRUD apps. No one is coming to Tunisia to hire people to work on parsers or compilers, they're hiring people to work on web apps built in Java or PHP or JS.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Totally agree with you. The problem is that most of the time, companies don't care how intelligent or curious you are, they just want someone that is familiar with their stack. The truth is, if you need to find a job as soon as possible, it's better to be a "frameworker".
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is my opinion based on my experience, (software) engineering schools in Tunisia suck ass. Students will claim they know C++ after doing some movie management project (or something like that) for class and put it on their CV, but they don't even know what RAII and smart pointers are. I know because I've been there and did that. But I guess it's okay, these are just students, but you claim there are people like this with multiple years of experience, which is much worse.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.890Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Honestly, I would've been a much better software engineer if I spent 5 years after my bac learning and building stuff that interests me instead of having to go through 2 years of bullshit prepa and 3 years of attending boring lectures. But I don't regret it because I'm very happy and proud of what I'm doing now and I wouldn't have been here without all that bullshit.

[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Couple of questions,
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: How much are you willing to pay for all these skills?
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Nothing specific but give a range.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also when you say, consultancy focused on connecting highly skilled engineers :
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You mean a classical ESN ?
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.891Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:40:23.892Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

The expressed need for skilled developers and the discussion around hiring challenges suggest a potential interest in alternative solutions like Vibe coding. However, the focus is more on skills and experience gaps rather than directly looking for new hiring solutions.

[2025-05-27T19:40:44.120Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:40:44.120Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am fairly new at the company and sort of working on my own in this research path, and i have developed a demo software just to show case the tools interactions etc, along with other tools that automate lots of the manual processes regarding handling and processing patients and image data. although my knowledge in software life cycle and development workflows is not comparable to a software developer.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am expecting the software developer to take over the software related development so i can focus on my field of expertise. meaning that the new hire should bear with the responsibility that comes with this job as he would be the only expert in the expanding department i am in.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am feeling a bit stressed because i have never given a responsibility for such tasks, i want to be clear to the candidates on what to expect, at the same time i don't want to hear " it was your mistake hiring the wrong person " from my supervisor in the future if something goes unexpected way.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: After a long introduction, I would like to ask the following questions:
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. How many years of experience should i ask for?
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. What other technical skills should i ask for other than the essential ones for the job (QT,VTK, C++) ?

[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. How can i be as clear as possible with describing the workplace, tasks, etc?

[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Of course that depends on the length of the project, budget, and other factors, but it's just an option.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: You should hire someone you will want to work with, and it's good if he's passionate about your area.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It's good if he has working projects with that tech stack, it's easy for an application to become a complicated mess with C++ (this is true with every language)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.121Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Usually there will be some probationary period in which the candidate, if it turns out he / she doesn't fit at all, can be let go easily.

[2025-05-27T19:40:44.127Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A good way to get started would be to try and find people through your network. I've found that sourcing from your network usually works out well.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.127Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also, don't be afraid to reject someone quickly if you aren't a 100% on them. You have a limited amount of time and effort to spend on the hiring process and you should optimize for candidates that you have a good feeling about. Don't let the fear of missing out on someone who maybe could be a good fit guide you.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.127Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In your situation, I think you want someone who can work on their own and can deal with some amount of uncertainty. There are software developers who are good, but need their tasks scoped out for them - you likely don't want someone like that. Also look for someone you'd like to work with.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.127Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One thing I like to ask when I am interviewing someone is for them to talk about something they worked on, could be anything, that they are excited to talk about. If they can explain the problem and how they solved it reasonably well, and can reflect on what they would do differently now and reason about the trade-off made, then that is a good sign. Ask them what they would do differently now, and also try and probe some of their decision making. How they react to this will also tell you a lot about the person. Examples of things they can talk about could include

[2025-05-27T19:40:44.127Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Years of experience has surprisingly low correlation with skills and ability to deliver well.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Since this person will be the first and maybe the only engineer in your project, hire the best person your budget allows.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: But don't measure applicants based on years of experience.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >What other technical skills should i ask for other than the essential ones for the job (QT,VTK, C++) ?
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ask only for things you actually need. And even there, make compromises on earlier experience, if you find someone who has both technical skills and good attitude.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would ask for C++ experience and willingness to learn QT and VTK. Experience with VTK and QT as a plus.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >What values/personalities do you usually look for in a candidate?
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Willingness and ability to learn. Pragmatic. Respectful communication. Decent person.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >If you have any other advice, please go ahead!
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You would want a fair and unbiased comparison. Make a script of standard questions you ask from candidates. It's ok to adjust the script based on the things you learn during the interviews, but you need some structure and reasonable basis for comparison.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interviewing is a two ways street, you also need to sell the role to the candidates. You might want to start with an introduction of the company and the role, and have time for questions at the end.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You might want to capacity limit how many people you call in, so you can be responsive and have a smooth process for them. Don't ghost people, inform them about the next steps, also if you decide to not continue with them. Consult with HR about if you can give feedback

[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.128Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.129Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.130Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.130Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:40:44.130Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:41:09.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would *love* to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a handful of things you need to consider: how involved do you want to be? How much $ do you want to invest? What is your tolerance for risk? And, where is your expertise? Then you have a few options.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A: offshore team or staff augmentation:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you know exactly what you want to have done and you can build a roadmap, hold a team accountable to their deliverables, sense BS in a technical setting, then this is a good option. You can save money going this route if you have a somewhat time-boxed project, but you need strong management a
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: nd very strong communication and product direction. This may be less expensive but it costs your time and you need to know what you want.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: B. Hire an engineer:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It sounds like you would need to hire a Jack-of-all-trades full stack developer, and an employee of course needs management support and resources to thrive in their role. Look for someone who has experience in a few different tech stacks and languages. Expect to pay a relatively high salary for someone with experience in architecture design, team leadership, devops and systems integration. I love these people but they can be difficult to find. Lots of engineers _think_ they are like this, but it’s a special person who can fill the role of the first/only software developer at a growing company in a competitive field. This is a great longer term choice that produces good quality custom work if you find the right fit, but you need solid management and goals in place or this will frustrate you very much. You’ll also need to hire more engineers down the road, need a plan for software testing, build tech policies, all that.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: C. Hire a 3rd party company.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Search for “digital innovation” or “custom software” or look at “beaugmented.ai” and ask to set up an intro call. These firms can build a team of the right types of engineers, developers, managers, qa, product people and designers that fits your needs and stays in your budget. They will work with you to define exactly what you want and tell you what to expect in terms of timelines and roadmaps, they should be able to help you get to a small, working project and grow from there as your company grows. They will care about making you money because they should understand your business needs. This may be an expensive option upfront but it will get you to your goal faster and much better, especially if you don’t have a cto or technical team in-house. Unless you plan to build out a whole software team internally (at least 4 people) then this is usually the best way.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Again, I’d love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You...may want to employ a company that makes line of business software.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It depends on how complex your needs are.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would recommend against just hiring a solitary programmer and expecting the moon. First, likely the programmer has gaps in their knowledge. If not, they are likely either very expensive or very inexperienced (and faking it). Finally, having someone test their own work is bad practice.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.464Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:41:09.465Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:41:24.396Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.397Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. There is a mix of **pragmatic advice** and **personal anecdotes**, which creates a sense of community and shared experience. Some comments carry a slightly **defensive tone**, especially when addressing stereotypes about Polish software engineers.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.397Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.397Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward and **direct**, often using **first-person perspectives** ("I have setup," "I used agencies"). There is minimal use of slang, but some comments include casual phrases like "ping me" and "crazy to hire in," which contribute to the informal tone. Abbreviations are not prevalent, but there are some industry-specific terms (e.g., "RPO," "headhunter") that suggest familiarity with the IT field.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.397Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.397Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being concise and to the point (1-2 sentences), while others provide more detailed insights (3-5 sentences). The length often correlates with the complexity of the advice being given; more nuanced recommendations tend to be longer.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.397Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.398Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual** rather than formal. While most comments are mostly grammatically correct, there are occasional typos or informal constructions (e.g., "poeple" instead of "people"). This reflects the

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks.

And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:41:24.402Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1) Best investment was a local manager with experience who could draw on their existing employees to set this up quickly with competent staff.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.402Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2) Personally interview all programmers for competency and 'cultural fit'
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.402Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3) I used agencies initially and got mediocre results, which led to the above change in strategy.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.402Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4) Polish IT market is currently crazy to hire in, high demand for skills causing high demand in wages.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.402Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'd probably not build a service desk there again today. I'd probably look at alternative slavic countries.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.402Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: If you want to stay within the EU, polish developers are by far the best around. My advice is to go with a small company or even look for individual senior developers. Large consulting companies got large by ripping off inexperienced customers like yourself and by exploiting and underpaying the workforce.

[2025-05-27T19:41:24.404Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Hiring software engineers in Poland
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Hi there,
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am from Ireland and I am looking for some help/ advice. I currently work with a company and we are looking at creating a software application. We are struggling to find the support and people in Ireland and I am considering using remote options in Europe. From Google there is some great reviews about Polish software engineers.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Are there any companies that can assist with this? I have the idea on what needs to be done but I am very unsure of the price and time involved. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/poland
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I have setup support centres in Poland (Wroclaw).
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Quick notes:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1) Best investment was a local manager with experience who could draw on their existing employees to set this up quickly with competent staff.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2) Personally interview all programmers for competency and 'cultural fit'
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3) I used agencies initially and got mediocre results, which led to the above change in strategy.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4) Polish IT market is currently crazy to hire in, high demand for skills causing high demand in wages.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'd probably not build a service desk there again today. I'd probably look at alternative slavic countries.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you want to stay within the EU, polish developers are by far the best around. My advice is to go with a small company or even look for individual senior developers. Large consulting companies got large by ripping off inexperienced customers like yourself and by exploiting and underpaying the workforce.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am Polish IT engineer, living and working in Ireland. Ping me if you need any help!

[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: "From Google there is some great reviews about Polish software engineers."
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Wow, usually everyone's humiliating and bashing Polish software engineers telling how they can't do anything and much they suck and how they write bad code.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hire RPO or a good headhunter. I work for Intel right now and look for poeple everyday. There are dozens of great specialists, depending on who you search for. I mean - if you have recruiter in your company they should already know how to source regardless of the country.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.405Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustra
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: tion or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.406Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:41:24.407Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

The commenters are providing practical advice based on their experiences and knowledge in the tech industry. There is a sense of urgency and seriousness in the recommendations, reflecting the challenges of finding the right technical talent for startups. While the tone is primarily serious, there are moments of casualness, particularly in the use of abbreviations and informal language.

[2025-05-27T19:41:44.157Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is predominantly **straightforward and direct**, with a focus on clarity. There are instances of **technical jargon** (e.g., "SWE," "CTO," "senior software engineer") that indicate familiarity with the industry. Some comments include **abbreviations** (e.g., "Tbh" for "to be honest") and phrases that reflect a conversational style. The use of phrases like "good luck" and "you get what you pay for" adds a colloquial touch.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:41:44.159Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Noob question here. I am planning to launch a business that, though not a pure “tech” company, has some core software elements. My background is more on the business side and I know next to nothing about engineering. Can anyone recommend how I might go about defining the right type of engineer for what I want to build, and then any resources for finding those folks to hire, ideally on a part time or contract basis? Thank you!
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.159Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.159Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: If you know nothing you can be taken for a ride. The kind of code and engineering you need to build for a one person shop or for a ten person shop or for a non-technical company is totally different than for a large corporate employer for example. For your case continuity of business and documentation will be extremely important as well speed onboarding new developers but to get someone who actually cares about that will be a miracle since most people don't.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.159Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ideally you have an experienced and highly invested technical cofounder. If you don't -- good luck.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.159Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I think you need a technical partner/cofounder. Or at least a CTO? So this person can answer all the questions you have and then proceed with the hiring process for the rest of the team/company.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.159Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Look on LinkedIn for senior contract / freelance engineers with a record in a relevant area. Speak to a few. Discuss tech / engineering strategies at a high level. Pick one you trust to help you get the project started.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.159Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Don't cheap out. You get what you pay for in this business. Someone cheap is cheap for a reason. You might not realise they're clueless until you have built a functional turd. They themselves might not even realise they're clueless.

[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Hiring software engineers
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Noob question here. I am planning to launch a business that, though not a pure “tech” company, has some core software elements. My background is more on the business side and I know next to nothing about engineering. Can anyone recommend how I might go about defining the right type of engineer for what I want to build, and then any resources for finding those folks to hire, ideally on a part time or contract basis? Thank you!

[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you know nothing you can be taken for a ride. The kind of code and engineering you need to build for a one person shop or for a ten person shop or for a non-technical company is totally different than for a large corporate employer for example. For your case continuity of business and documentation will be extremely important as well speed onboarding new developers but to get someone who actually cares about that will be a miracle since most people don't.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Ideally you have an experienced and highly invested technical cofounder. If you don't -- good luck.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I think you need a technical partner/cofounder. Or at least a CTO? So this person can answer all the questions you have and then proceed with the hiring process for the rest of the team/company.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Look on LinkedIn for senior contract / freelance engineers with a record in a relevant area. Speak to a few. Discuss tech / engineering strategies at a high level. Pick one you trust to help you get the project started.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Don't cheap out. You get what you pay for in this business. Someone cheap is cheap for a reason. You might not realise they're clueless until you have built a functional turd. They themselves might not even realise they're clueless.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Your best bet is to find someone to cofound with that is technical. That means you’re probably going to look for someone with several years of experience at the Senior Software Engineer level or above. I’d caution you to stay away from freelancers, like the ones spamming your inbox referencing this post. You want to find someone who is invested in the process, and that you can see yourself working with in the long term.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Tbh that’s probably going to be very, very difficult to find given that most decent engineers that are able to help are already going to be pulling in great salaries.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Not a SWE but in Tech. I'd advise, at least, looking into working with a consultant or advisor from the SWE area for this. Someone who you can chat to about your bus
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: iness and can educate you a bit of what that means you'll need. And even have them in on interviewing your first hire.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.160Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I was the first Data Science hire into a startup, and they used a consultant just like this. It made them much more aware of what they needed and how they should evaluate candidates. In the end, it worked out really well for everyone.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Failing that, concentrate on getting a good senior first hire who can talk "business" with you and help translate from "tech" into "business" and back. And then rely on this person to bring in what you need.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.161Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.162Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.162Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.162Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.162Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.162Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:41:44.162Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:42:02.660Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.660Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overall tone of the comments is **pragmatic and straightforward**. The commenters express a mix of skepticism and realism regarding startup ideas and the process of engaging developers. There is a sense of **candidness** as they share their experiences and expectations, often highlighting the challenges and realities of the startup ecosystem. While the tone is largely serious, there are moments of **informality** and **directness**, especially when addressing common pitfalls or misconceptions.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.660Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.660Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Direct Language**: The commenters use clear and direct language, often employing imperative statements (e.g., "Do not be coy with your business idea"). This reflects a no-nonsense approach to conveying their thoughts.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.660Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Technical Terminology**: There is a noticeable use of industry-specific jargon related to software development and startups (e.g., "MVP," "iterative processes," "scope," "equity"). This indicates that the audience is expected to have some level of familiarity with these concepts.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.660Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Colloquialisms**: Phrases like "99% of ideas are shit" and "cheap offshoring always fails" add a casual, conversational flair, making the comments relatable and grounded in real-world experiences.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.660Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **List Format**: Several comments utilize bullet points or numbered lists to organize thoughts, making the information easily digest

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:42:02.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Lately, we have been discussing non-stop about an idea for a startup, that we very firmly believe in, and we are ready to invest every penny we made in the past.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: We would like to get our idea to a somewhat working product before we apply for funding
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Since we are not that tech savvy when it comes to coding, our biggest concern is, how do we hire/find programmers who would either like to join us (another co-founder is a possibility), or hire him full time to work on the project.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Programmers, coders, how would you like to be approached when it comes to such situations?
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TL;DR - We have a startup idea and a small budget, how do we find programmers for it?
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit: Budget is around $10k

[2025-05-27T19:42:02.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I get approached quite often on linked in. The issue is - 99% of ideas are shit, have no chance of competing or I don't trust the person i'm talking to.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If I were you - get a freelancer, build a MVP, get investment and hire people. If you can convince an investor then you'll usually be able to convince other people your idea is a go.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Your job is to sell me the project and the vision.

[2025-05-27T19:42:02.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Direct Language**: The commenters use clear and direct language, often employing imperative statements (e.g., "Do not be coy with your business idea"). This reflects a no-nonsense approach to conveying their thoughts.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Technical Terminology**: There is a noticeable use of industry-specific jargon related to software development and startups (e.g., "MVP," "iterative processes," "scope," "equity"). This indicates that the audience is expected to have some level of familiarity with these concepts.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Colloquialisms**: Phrases like "99% of ideas are shit" and "cheap offshoring always fails" add a casual, conversational flair, making the comments relatable and grounded in real-world experiences.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **List Format**: Several comments utilize bullet points or numbered lists to organize thoughts, making the information easily digest
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== USER PROMPT ==========
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Hiring programmers for your startup idea, how do I approach this?
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Myself and my co-founder have been working in e-commerce and design for quite a while now, established a couple of businesses together, and we've been a pretty decent duo.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Lately, we have been discussing non-stop about an idea for a startup, that we very firmly believe in, and we are ready to invest every penny we made in the past.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: We would like to get our idea to a somewhat working product before we apply for funding
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Since we are not that tech savvy when it comes to coding, our biggest concern is, how do we hire/find programmers who would either like to join us (another co-founder is a possibility), or hire him full time to work on the project.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Programmers, coders, how would you like to be approached when it comes to such situations?
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TL;DR - We have a startup idea and a small budget, how do we find programmers for it?
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit: Budget is around $10k
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/startups
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: How I like to be approached: "Here's the idea that we have, the research we've done (formal document), and 3-5 customers who have agreed that if we build this they will use it."
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I get approached quite often on linked in. The issue is - 99% of ideas are shit, have no chance of competing or I don't trust the person i'm talking to.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If I were you - get a freelancer, build a MVP, get investment and hire people. If you can convince an investor then you'll usually be able to convince other people your idea is a go.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Your job is to sell me the project and the vision.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you cant sell your product and vision to your team. How are you going to sell it to the public or VC’s?
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.665Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.665Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I was recently approached by a startup and agreed to join because it allows me to combine development with another interest (my background is in the music industry prior to getting into tech, and this company is in that space). Also, as a developer, it was appealing that they had decided to use a really cool tech stack, and the project requires us to solve interesting problems.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.665Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Edit: Point being, developers often have enough options to be picky. If your startup scratches some itch, in the subject matter, the technology used, or the type of problems that need to be solved, good devs will be a lot more likely to consider joining you, and perhaps be willing to work for a bit less than market, at least in the early stages.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.665Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.665Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Don’t ask them to sign an NDA before describing the product
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.666Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: idea. Huge red flag.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.666Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Don’t assume they are a him.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do try to learn about software engineering and how it is very different from any kind of static asset creation. It’s not like lego blocks or building a house from a blueprint. More like composing music or painting, it’s not a linear progress bar of doneness.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do learn that less is more and avoid piling on too many speculative features. Figure out the smallest possible feature set with no bells and whistles and just make that a perfect user experience first. Once you have users it will become easier to know what to build next.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do learn about iterative processes. The best way to succeed in software is to understand that if you want a fixed high level of quality and to keep timelines, the number one safe variable to manipulate is scope, so find ways of reducing it at every turn in order to de-risk.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do pay market rates. Cheap offshoring always fails. Expect to rewrite the entire codebase several times if you go down that route.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do not expect over time and heroic dedication just because you can think of exciting ideas for 23 hours a day. Programming requires a deep state of flow and uses much more energy than other kinds of mental work. If you expect them to perform like a cofounder then they need to have enough equity to make that realistic. But equity is worth nothing until they have created the product for you, so protect their health and work-life balance like it’s the only asset you have, because it is.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Do understand that every single meeting or phone call literally subtracts from productive engineering time. Attention is a finite  and precious resource and should not be used up frivolously. It takes hours to context switch from extroverted meeting mode to introverted flow mode. Each interruption just delays timelines by the length of the interruption plus a tax of several hours. Asking for progress updates until a pre-agreed deadline is a fools errand.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.667Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T19:42:02.668Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire, tips for hiring software engineers, where to hire contract software developers). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T19:42:23.536Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is a mix of **informal and conversational**, with a hint of **frustration** and **cynicism** in some responses. The initial comment has a more **professional** tone, reflecting the speaker's experience and structured approach to interviewing. In contrast, the subsequent comments express varying levels of dissatisfaction with traditional interview methods and the expectations placed on candidates.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T19:42:23.539Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm a software engineer at a large company based in the bay and I've recently been interviewing people quite a bit to fill mid career full stack engineering and QA Automation engineer roles. After awhile I've noticed some patterns from applicants that I wanted to share for anyone actively looking for work. These have come up multiple times in round table discussions with other interviewers about candidates and seem like easy gets if people were aware of them:
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.539Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. When doing a technical problem always explain what your game plan is before you begin to solve the challenge and why you think it will work. There is usually a brute force or naive solution that you can reach somewhat easily and many applicants jump into coding that immediately before discussing their thoughts. Depending on the role, this may or may not be acceptable, but if I'm looking for something more complex I'm happy to nudge the candidate toward a better method if that's what I'm looking for. If I just want the naive solution, I'll say its fine and to proceed - going super complex right out of the gate without explaining the naive solution may make it seem like you're over-engineering the problem or aren't practical (especially if your complex solution is wrong).  I get the sense that most candidates are anxious to prove that they can code and dive in hastily. This is considered a red flag and usually results in negative marks in the critical thinking column.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.539Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Start with test cases. Even if you don't practice test driven development, this shows foresight and gives the interviewer a chance to course correct fundamental misunderstandings about the problem at hand. Even if you don't execute them by the end, write them in comments - show the input and expected output. Try to think up as many edge cases as possible. Once you're most of the way through the problem and you realize you fundamentally misunderstood something its too late for me to help.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.539Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. If you stop talking for more than a minute people become worried about your ability to communicate your thought process. Even if you're stuck, talk about why you're stuck and if you are unable to make progress just admit it and I'm happy to offer some leading hints. I want to see that you can think critically and program, not that you know the 'trick' to getting the optimal solution.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.539Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. If you can only do the naive solution and you're not prompted for something harder, try to explain the more complex solu
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.540Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: tion when you're done as best you can. I've passed multiple people through phone screens who would not otherwise have gotten through because I knew they understood that their solution wasn't the best, they just didn't think of the optimal one immediately. If we have time and I want to see something more complex I'll ask you to try to implement it.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.540Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. In your questions for the interviewer ask about the team. Often the deciding factor for myself and my colleagues concerning a couple of candidates has been whether we got the feeling that the person would be satisfied in the role they're applying for. We don't want to hire someone who is going to leave in a year, engagement is incredibly important. On multiple occasions we have selected someone who was not quite as technically advanced as someone else because they seemed enthusiastic about what the team was working on.

Most of the comments have been people angry about the technical interview process and I don't blame you for it - its very uncomfortable and feels artificial (because it is). I'll repeat here what I've been telling a lot of people in replies - success in the technical interview does not equate to knowing the answer. Knowing it is good, of course, but to be honest people don't get the hard problems completely right most of the time. When someone breezes through something, we jump script to something harder until we are at the point that the person has to reason through a problem. The goal is to see how the person thinks, if their reasoning and logic is sound, not that they remember an answer to a vague puzzle. If that was the goal then I would agree that technical interviews are a pretty useless indicator of actual job performance.

[2025-05-27T19:42:23.540Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: As an interviewer, something I've been doing with good success over the last couple of years is sending out a very simple programming exercise to complete in advance of the interview. The candidate can do it in their own time using whatever resources they want and they can take as long as they like. The problem is very simple, something that any first year comp-sci student should be able to easily complete in an hour and an experienced developer should be able to do it in about half an hour. Most people seem to really enjoy doing the exercise - some clearly spend a lot of time on it trying to perfect their solution.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.540Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For such a simple problem, I've actually seen a huge variation in the kinds of solutions that are provided, even among people of similar experience and ability. Some people write a concise 20 line function and call it job done while some go the opposite direction and create a fully object oriented solution with multiple classes. Neither is necessarily any more correct than the other. Aside from weeding out the people who just can't program or who write awful code, what it's great for is differentiating between people who just know how to write code, and people who actually know how to engineer software, and there is a big difference.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.540Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Aside from the basics - does it actually solve the problem correctly and with reasonably well written code - what I'm really looking for are things like unit tests, documentation, build instructions (or better yet, a nice cross-platform build script), explicitly stated assumptions (e.g. whether or not to do any input validation and if so, how to handle error cases) and the overall approach.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.540Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I then spend a good portion of the interview discussing the candidate's solution. I ask them how they decided on the solution that they did, what alternatives they considered, what - if any - problems they ran into, whether they would change anything in retrospect etc. I then ask them to discuss how they would modify their solution to cope with certain changes to the requirements. What if you now had to run this on a microcontroller with a very limited amount of memory? Now what if this operation that they were assuming would be fast was actually connected to a very slow piece of hardware that took a second to respond? That kind of thing.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.540Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I've found that this is a much better indicator of ability than getting people to try to write code on a whiteboard under pressure. I can't write code on a whiteboard! Nobody codes by writing line 1, then line 2, then line 3. You end up inserting lines, moving things around, filling in loop bodies after creating the loop structure etc. Not only that, but in practice, we spend a lot of time looking up documentation and, let's be honest, places like stackoverflow. It's just not worth wasting the time to memorize a large standard library or, in some cases, certain aspects of the language or syntax (moreso for things like C++) when I can just spend 10 seconds on Google to find if the function I need exists or what is the correct signature for a move constructor again. So asking somebody to stand up at a whiteboard and do it blind is unfair, I think.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.541Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I do agree that having people *think out loud* is good. That's the thing I'm interested in! I want to know how you go about solving a problem; I want to know what your thought process is; I want to know all of the things that you're considering. I don't actually care too much about the solution you eventually come to, as long as it's well reasoned and thought out. I'd rather somebody spend 5 minutes explaining to me how they would, for example, reverse a linked list, with diagrams on a whiteboard, rather than spend 5 minutes in silence writing a perfect solution line by line on the board.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.541Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: >mid career
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.541Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Shit, I was hoping this kind of "combine and sort these two lists and then turn them into a binary tree and then reverse it" nonsense was going to become less of a thing later on in my career, not so much the centerpiece that it requires a 5-point list of psychological hints.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.541Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: This advice is literally straight from the google interview youtube video. I hate that this is the way things are run, I've interviewed people and the one thing I want is people that give a shit and are willing to grind. People who are hungry to learn and strive to better in tech. I understand if you're coming in as mid level and senior but an entry level dev/ automation should just be hungry .

[2025-05-27T19:42:23.543Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.543Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone:**
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.543Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is a mix of **informal and conversational**, with a hint of **frustration** and **cynicism** in some responses. The initial comment has a more **professional** tone, reflecting the speaker's experience and structured approach to interviewing. In contrast, the subsequent comments express varying levels of dissatisfaction with traditional interview methods and the expectations placed on candidates.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.543Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns:**
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language used is generally straightforward and accessible, with some technical jargon related to programming and software engineering. There are instances of **slang** and **informal expressions** (e.g., "job done," "nonsense," "give a shit"), particularly in the responses, which reflect a casual and sometimes blunt style. Abbreviations like "dev" for developer and phrases like "mid career" indicate a familiarity with the industry.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length:**
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The initial comment is quite lengthy and detailed, indicative of a thoughtful and thorough perspective. In contrast, the responses vary in length, with some being short and direct (e.g., "Wow. As a developer...") while others provide more context or elaboration on their viewpoints. Overall, the length ranges from a few sentences to several paragraphs.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style:**
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar in the initial comment is generally **well-structured and formal**, with complete sentences and a

[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Some advice to software engineering candidates from an interviewer.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: I'm a software engineer at a large company based in the bay and I've recently been interviewing people quite a bit to fill mid career full stack engineering and QA Automation engineer roles. After awhile I've noticed some patterns from applicants that I wanted to share for anyone actively looking for work. These have come up multiple times in round table discussions with other interviewers about candidates and seem like easy gets if people were aware of them:
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. When doing a technical problem always explain what your game plan is before you begin to solve the challenge and why you think it will work. There is usually a brute force or naive solution that you can reach somewhat easily and many applicants jump into coding that immediately before discussing their thoughts. Depending on the role, this may or may not be acceptable, but if I'm looking for something more complex I'm happy to nudge the candidate toward a better method if that's what I'm looking for. If I just want the naive solution, I'll say its fine and to proceed - going super complex right out of the gate without explaining the naive solution may make it seem like you're over-engineering the problem or aren't practical (especially if your complex solution is wrong).  I get the sense that most candidates are anxious to prove that they can code and dive in hastily. This is considered a red flag and usually results in negative marks in the critical thinking column.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Start with test cases. Even if you don't practice test driven development, this shows foresight and gives the interviewer a chance to course correct fundamental misunderstandings about the problem at hand. Even if you don't execute them by the end, write them in comments - show the input and expected output. Try to think up as many edge cases as possible. Once you're most of the way through the problem and you realize you fundamentally misunderstood something its too late for me to help.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. If you stop talking for more than a minute people become worried about your ability to communicate your thought process. Even if you're stuck, talk about why you're stuck and if you are unable to make progress just admit it and I'm happy to offer some leading hints. I want to see that you can think critically and program, not that you know the 'trick' to getting the optimal solution.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. If you can only do the naive solution and you're not prompted for something hard
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.544Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: er, try to explain the more complex solution when you're done as best you can. I've passed multiple people through phone screens who would not otherwise have gotten through because I knew they understood that their solution wasn't the best, they just didn't think of the optimal one immediately. If we have time and I want to see something more complex I'll ask you to try to implement it.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.545Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. In your questions for the interviewer ask about the team. Often the deciding factor for myself and my colleagues concerning a couple of candidates has been whether we got the feeling that the person would be satisfied in the role they're applying for. We don't want to hire someone who is going to leave in a year, engagement is incredibly important. On multiple occasions we have selected someone who was not quite as technically advanced as someone else because they seemed enthusiastic about what the team was working on.
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.545Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: &#x200B;
[2025-05-27T19:42:23.545Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If anyone wants any specifics or has questions about interviewing I'd be happy to answer but I just wanted to share with folks here the common themes I've seen in the last couple of months. Good luck everyone :)
