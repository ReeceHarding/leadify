I am planning to launch a business that, though not a pure “tech” company, has some core software elements. My background is more on the business side and I know next to nothing about engineering. Can anyone recommend how I might go about defining the right type of engineer for what I want to build, and then any resources for finding those folks to hire, ideally on a part time or contract basis? Thank you!  [also make sure you feed in the other comments so our ai can refer to other comments genrally - like "i know a lot of other people here are recommending you learn to program yourself... and while i do think that's a valuable path i kind of think that's changing w/ the onset of vibe coding"]  also feed in published date, etc       this is how we should structure the comment:     hey man!  know this was posted a while ago but just wanted to share my experience in case anyone else is has a similar question  mostly just want to share bc i've been in your shoes before and kind of want to share my insights with everybody   so for a little background:   i've been building businesses for 7ish years  they've ranged from landscaping to dropshipping to marketing agencies  now after like seven years i finally have my first successful business   and the main lesson i've learned is that there are kind of two main paths you can go down based on how you want to balance the money/time equation  what's that mean?  essentially you can either pay w/ money or time    paying with time:  i know a lot of people here are recommending learning to program yourself  and while i sort of agree, i'd like to provide some insight    when i was younger, this is the path i took for everything   a few examples:  1. i built all my website from scratch on wordpress before learning there was such a thing as templates - probably wasted 5-6 weeks on this 2. i built a messaging app form scratch using cursor and it took like 4-5 weeks before i found out there's a fully functinal open source project i could have just copied straight away. i ended up deleting my old project and cloning the open source 3. i tried learning how to run facebook ads and wasted like $2k on ads and got zero sales. then i asked my friend to help me and we instantly started making money  so i just share all of that to say that i've learned that it's often better idea to leverage peoples' expertise rather than trying to build things from scratch    this is kind of how i think through problems now when helping friends:   i think there are two main questions to ask: is your time valuable and is this a skill you want to invest in learning    here's how I think through the value of time:  if you're in college and you make $11 / hour working at the cafeteria, your time is essentially worthless right now, so you want to optimize for spending time rather than money  for you this would look like learning to code yourself   you MUST learn to vibe code rather than code by hand. i can't stress this enough. it'll expedite your learning by 10-20x  in this scenario, i'd recommend watching mckay wrigley's o1 pro tutorial.  in my opinion his work is kind of the gold standard for this industry  just crack open cursor and start building  i will warn you though, while you'll feel productive in the beginning, the end is a f*cking pain in the ass  deploying your app and setting up security is proabbly 80-90% of the battle  for example, it took me like 6 weeks to build out the prototype for my first cursor app but then it probably took me another 16 weeks (working like 12+ hours / day) before i got it deployed and security working and all bugs ironed out  in this scenario, i spent like 1800 hours building the app which was fine since i was in school but now i make $50/hour so this app literally would have cost me $90,000 in opportunity cost     part 2:  is this a skill you'll want going forward or is this a one off thing?  ie do you enjoy programming more or do you enjoy the business side of things more  if you want to get into programming, then taking time to learn the skill is 100% worthwhile  if you're just going to use this skillset to complete this project, then in my opinion it makes more sense   to get somebody else to use their skillset to build the software  for instance, i like marketing so that's where i focus my energy but my friends enjoy programming so i have them build me awesome software and in exchange i help them get the word out about their products    if you decide your time is either more valuable than the tiem it would take to do the project or it's a skill you don't want to invest in, i'd recommend you outsource the work.  here you again have two choices:  bring somebody in house or contract the work out    bring somebody in house:  this either would be a technical cofounder or employee  cofounder  if you have somebody in your life that's willing to join your company right now that's the path i'd recommend - that being said in my experience that's a huge commitment on their part and it's been almost impossible for me to bring on anyone valuable enough unless you guys are practically best friends   employee  This is good if you have ongoing tasks that you need to be done. Like you have a bunch of products you need to be built. But this is also kind of a pain in the ass because you have to do hiring and sh*t  if you're looking to hire, dm me and i can send you some tips. one fo the main ones that has worked for my friends is putting a mini challenge in the job posting like "you must include the word 'orange' in your application" and you'd be shocked at the amount of applications that won't follow instructions. there's just tons of bots that like 95% of them won't actually customzie the applications, they'll just spam applications  also adding a bit of friction through video interviews is really good    alright, without further adu 🥁  agencies  for years i used to focus solely on doing things myself    but nowadays this is the path i almost always use personally  for my case, it works really well bc i've built a network of people i trust and i cna just iMessage them for tasks i want to be done and they'll just send me working software like 1-2 weeks later  for me, it's just the fastest and most effective way  i just have a few friends who have done ai bootcamps and shit and they're able to whip up full apps in like a day or two and they send me a loom and i send over my suggestions and we usually have a full app ina week or so   i don't want to dox them, but if youre interested in the list dm me w/ your particular project details and i'll ask my friend if he can help you out    anyways hoped this helped   TL;DR  if in college or want to learn the skill: teach yourself  if have close technical friend: get him to join as technical cofounder  if have you have a good amount of work and have experience hiring: employee  solution i'd recommend: agencies      ---  and for micro prompt output fo rthe comment:  hey man  just saw your post   assume you've figure everythihng out, but just wanted to throw my two cents if anyone else comes across this post  in my opinion this is how i'd break down the problem  if you're in college or have ample free time: teach yourself. i'd recommend mckay wrigley's o1 pro walk through on YT (dm me and i can send you the link)  if have close technical friend: get him to join as technical cofounder  if have you have a good amount of work and have experience hiring: hire employee on linkedin or indeed job board. i'd strongly recomend putting a challenge in your listing like "add the worg orange to your application" - i

[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hiring software engineers
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Noob question here. I am planning to launch a business that, though not a pure “tech” company, has some core software elements. My background is more on the business side and I know next to nothing about engineering. Can anyone recommend how I might go about defining the right type of engineer for what I want to build, and then any resources for finding those folks to hire, ideally on a part time or contract basis? Thank you!
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: [also make sure you feed in the other comments so our ai can refer to other comments genrally - like "i know a lot of other people here are recommending you learn to program yourself... and while i do think that's a valuable path i kind of think that's changing w/ the onset of vibe coding"]
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: also feed in published date, etc
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: this is how we should structure the comment:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: hey man!
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: know this was posted a while ago but just wanted to share my experience in case anyone else is has a similar question
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: mostly just want to share bc i've been in your shoes before and kind of want to share my insights with everybody
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: so for a little background:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: i've been building businesses for 7ish years
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: they've ranged from landscaping to dropshipping to marketing agencies
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: now after like seven years i finally have my first successful business
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: and the main lesson i've learned is that there are kind of two main paths you can go down based on how you want to balance the money/time equation
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: what's that mean?
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: essentially you can either pay w/ money or time
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: paying with time:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: i know a lot of people here are recommending learning to program yourself
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: and while i sort of agree, i'd like to provide some insight
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: when i was younger, this is the path i took for everything
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: a few examples:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. i built all my website from scratch on wordpress before learning there was such a thing as templates - probably wasted 5-6 weeks on this
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. i built a messaging app form scratch using cursor and it took like 4-5 weeks before i found out there's a fully functinal open source project i could have just copied straight away. i ended up deleting my old project and cloning the open source
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. i tried learning how to run facebook ads and wasted like $2k on ads and got zero sales. then i asked my friend to help me and we instantly started making money
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: so i just share all of that to say that i've learned that it's often better idea to leverage peoples' expertise rather than trying to build things from scratch
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: this is kind of how i think through problems now when helping friends:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.662Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: i think there are two main questions to ask: is your time valuable and is this a skill you want to invest in learning
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: here's how I think through the value of time:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if you're in college and you make $11 / hour working at the cafeteria, your time is essentially worthless right now, so you want to optimize for spending time rather than money
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: for you this would look like learning to code yourself
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: you MUST learn to vibe code rather than code by hand. i can't stress this enough. it'll expedite your learning by 10-20x
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: in this scenario, i'd recommend watching mckay wrigley's o1 pro tutorial.
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: in my opinion his work is kind of the gold standard for this industry
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: just crack open cursor and start building
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: i will warn you though, while you'll feel productive in the beginning, the end is a f*cking pain in the ass
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: deploying your app and setting up security is proabbly 80-90% of the battle
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: for example, it took me like 6 weeks to build out the prototype for my first cursor app but then it probably took me another 16 weeks (working like 12+ hours / day) before i got it deployed and security working and all bugs ironed out
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: in this scenario, i spent like 1800 hours building the app which was fine since i was in school but now i make $50/hour so this app literally would have cost me $90,000 in opportunity cost
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: part 2:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: is this a skill you'll want going forward or is this a one off thing?
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ie do you enjoy programming more or do you enjoy the business side of things more
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if you want to get into programming, then taking time to learn the skill is 100% worthwhile
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if you're just going to use this skillset to complete this project, then in my opinion it makes more sense
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: to get somebody else to use their skillset to build the software
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: for instance, i like marketing so that's where i focus my energy but my friends enjoy programming so i have them build me awesome software and in exchange i help them get the word out about their products
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if you decide your time is either more valuable than the tiem it would take to do the project or it's a skill you don't want to invest in, i'd recommend you outsource the work.
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: here you again have two choices:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: bring somebody in house or contract the work out
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: bring somebody in house:
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: this either would be a technical cofounder or employee
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: cofounder
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if you have somebody in your life that's willing to join your company right now that's the path i'd recommend - that being said in my experience that's a huge commitment on their part and it's been almost impossible for me to bring on anyone valuable enough unless you guys are practically best friends
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: employee
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: This is good if you have ongoing tasks that you need to be done. Like you have a bunch of products you need to be built. But this is also kind of a pain in the ass because you have to do hiring and sh*t
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if you're looking to hire, dm me and i can send you some tips. one fo the main ones that has worked for my friends is putting a mini challenge in the job posting like "you must include the word 'orange' in your application" and you'd be shocked at the amount of applications that won't follow instructions. there's just tons of bots that like 95% of them won't actually customzie the applications, they'll just spam applications
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: also adding a bit of friction through video interviews is really good
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: alright, without further adu 🥁
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: agencies
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: for years i used to focus solely on doing things myself
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: but nowadays this is the path i almost always use personally
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: for my case, it works really well bc i've built a network of people i trust and i cna just iMessage them for tasks i want to be done and they'll just send me working software like 1-2 weeks later
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: for me, it's just the fastest and most effective way
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: i just have a few friends who have done ai bootcamps and shit and they're able to whip up full apps in like a day or two and they send me a loom and i send over my suggestions and we usually have a full app ina week or so
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: i don't want to dox them, but if youre interested in the list dm me w/ your particular project details and i'll ask my friend if he can help you out
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: anyways hoped this helped
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TL;DR
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if in college or want to learn the skill: teach yourself
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if have close technical friend: get him to join as technical cofounder
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if have you have a good amount of work and have experience hiring: employee
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: solution i'd recommend: agencies
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---

[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: just saw your post
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: assume you've figure everythihng out, but just wanted to throw my two cents if anyone else comes across this post
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: in my opinion this is how i'd break down the problem
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if you're in college or have ample free time: teach yourself. i'd recommend mckay wrigley's o1 pro walk through on YT (dm me and i can send you the link)
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if have close technical friend: get him to join as technical cofounder
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: if have you have a good amount of work and have experience hiring: hire employee on linkedin or indeed job board. i'd strongly recomend putting a challenge in your li
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: sting like "add the worg orange to your application" - it'll filter out all the bots which is like 95% or more.. it's insane
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: oh also i'd recommend requiring like a 60 second video to add a second filter if you want to filter down to just hte most commited applicants ^
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: otherwise, i personally use agencies. i have a few friends who graduated gauntlet ai if you've heard of that and are starting a vibe coding agency who help me w/ my software - dm me your idea and i'll shoot them a text asking if it's something they could help me
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🎨 [TONE-REGENERATE] Existing Micro: hey dude, you might wanna check out platforms like GitHub for some free resources, tho they can be limited. if you're lookin for something quick and cost-effective, new cco vibe might be a good fit but keep in mind they might not handle super niche needs. for a more premium option, consider big firms like Accenture if budget isn't a problem.
[2025-05-27T21:31:30.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🎨 [TONE-REGENERATE] Existing Medium: tbh, i've been down this road. tried using GitHub for free resources - it's a start but kinda limited. new cco vibe does fast and cheap work, and they're pretty solid for straightforward projects, tho they're not always the best for super complex stuff. if you've got the cash, a premium firm like Deloitte might be worth it, but they can be overkill for a small biz.
