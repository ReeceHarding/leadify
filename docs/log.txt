[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly **casual** and **conversational**, with some instances of **humor** and **sarcasm**. Users express their opinions and experiences in a straightforward manner, often using informal language and emojis to convey emotions. There is a sense of camaraderie among commenters, as they share similar frustrations or insights about the use of AI tools in a corporate environment.
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language patterns include the use of **slang** and **abbreviations** (e.g., "GH Copilot," "🤷‍♀️"). Emojis are used to add emotional nuance and lighten the conversation. There are also instances of rhetorical questions and informal phrases ("how about humans?"), which contribute to the casual tone. The comments reflect a mix of technical jargon related to coding and AI, alongside everyday language.
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, but they tend to be **moderate**—long enough to convey a complete thought or argument but not overly verbose. Most comments are a few sentences to a paragraph long, allowing for concise expression of ideas while maintaining engagement.
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.994Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**. While some comments are well-structured, others exhibit informal grammar, such as incomplete sentences or colloquial expressions. This reflects the platform's informal

[2025-05-27T16:42:20.996Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In light of what's been happening with Open AI, this blog we wrote is still relevant:
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.996Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A few weeks ago, I was with a group of CTOs when someone asked: *does your company let your engineers use AI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT?*
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.996Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I thought the question was strange. What do you mean *let*? They're going to use it no matter what you say. AI code generation tools offer engineers a huge productivity boost. The ability to autocomplete code in seconds or work through a problem with AI isn’t an opportunity developers will pass up.
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.996Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: When we drilled into why this group was reluctant to allow their engineers to use AI, it became apparent that their reservations centered primarily on one concern: the absence of a robust testing framework to give them confidence in the code generated by AI.
[2025-05-27T16:42:20.996Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: But this is still flawed reasoning. If you’re not confident in using AI, how can you be confident in hiring new grads?

Like I'll write a comment on what I want a small snippet or function to do, let the AI scaffold it, then clean it up. It's slightly faster than typing it out myself and sometimes helps remind me of syntax as I use many different languages and frameworks.

[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.001Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T16:42:21.002Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (looking for help building internal tools for my company). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T16:42:37.329Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: How would you convince your senior executives to invest in LLM/RAG tooling to enhance existing business processes? Everything would need to be 100% on premise/locally hosted due to security requirements.
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.329Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Some idea thrown around have been:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.329Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Chatbot to ask questions about our internal tools, business processes, or company information. Mainly for onboarding support/new employees.
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.329Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. LLM to support document processing (quality, invoices, etc...). ex.) Ensuring tax info is correct or that the pricing/quantity info matches what was received/bought.
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.329Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. Generalized RAG/LLM solution to query our databases, visualize/analyze data, call internal APIs, etc...
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.329Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Has anyone gone through this before? Can traditional businesses benefit from building these skills within their developer workforce? What would be the minimum amount of investment needed to prove out some of these concepts in terms of GPUs, developer time, with minimal security risk. Thanks!

[2025-05-27T16:42:37.330Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Download AnythingLLM or openwebui and begin playing around with them. You can create a RAG using it and see how that goes. It's not going to get all of your stuff into a RAG, but does it all have to be in it? And if so, why not have different areas use separate instances of these AI toolkits using that areas RAG data that need?  All of these work spaces can be used with an API call as well.
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.330Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: These toolkits work with frontier providers as well as local LLMs and Openrouter.ai is very cheap for token usage on open source models, IMO.

[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I’d consider going with a mostly off the shelf vendor solution. These things aren’t trivial to build right now, and you might not get great results doing it all on your own, and then trying to keep up with advancements as time goes on.
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Glean for example is one that seems broadly used and that will get better over time. I’m sure there are others. Companies like that have sales people that provide all sorts of executive-friendly materials to convince them.
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: looking for help building internal tools for my company.
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.333Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:42:37.334Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)

[2025-05-27T16:42:51.029Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.030Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.030Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly casual and conversational. Users express their opinions and experiences with various knowledge management tools in a straightforward manner, often sharing frustrations and recommendations. There is an underlying sense of camaraderie among users as they discuss common challenges, which adds to the informal tone.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.030Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.030Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly straightforward and technical, reflecting the users' familiarity with the subject matter. There are instances of abbreviations (e.g., "iirc" for "if I recall correctly") and some informal phrases (e.g., "it's so irritating!"). Users also employ a mix of technical jargon (e.g., "partial markdown support," "block-based editor") and everyday language, making the comments accessible to a broader audience.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.030Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.030Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with some being quite brief (one or two sentences) while others are more detailed, providing context and personal experiences. The longer comments often include multiple sentences and a more structured argument, indicating a thoughtful response.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.030Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.030Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally casual, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or conversational phrasing. While most comments are coherent and easy to understand, they may not adhere strictly to formal grammar rules. For example, users often use ellipses or dashes to convey pauses or shifts in thought.

[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly casual and conversational. Users express their opinions and experiences with various knowledge management tools in a straightforward manner, often sharing frustrations and recommendations. There is an underlying sense of camaraderie among users as they discuss common challenges, which adds to the informal tone.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is mostly straightforward and technical, reflecting the users' familiarity with the subject matter. There are instances of abbreviations (e.g., "iirc" for "if I recall correctly") and some informal phrases (e.g., "it's so irritating!"). Users also employ a mix of technical jargon (e.g., "partial markdown support," "block-based editor") and everyday language, making the comments accessible to a broader audience.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with some being quite brief (one or two sentences) while others are more detailed, providing context and personal experiences. The longer comments often include multiple sentences and a more structured argument, indicating a thoughtful response.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.031Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally casual, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or conversational phrasing. While most comments are coherent and easy to understand, they may not adhere strictly to formal grammar rules. For example, users often use ellipses or dashes to convey pauses or shifts in thought.

[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I finally convinced a senior dev to use the internal wiki instead of a bunch of shared OneNote notebooks.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I’ll respond based on my background as a technical writer in a prior life, before becoming a PM.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The challenge with any knowledge base, whether it’s a wiki or a database such as Stack Overflow (which is what my company recently moved to), is that it can become a random collection of questions, answers, and one-off blurbs about any number of subjects.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The best “knowledge base” is structured and organized. It presents information in a meaningful way so that the reader can easily scan it and dig into it to find the information he/she needs. This requires careful editing so that's useful.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Recently started to use ClickUp but I wouldn't recommend it over Confluence. Editing is made a bit easier by partial markdown support, but it's nothing to be amazed by (iirc Confluence had similar features)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: looking for help building internal tools for my company.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.033Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T16:42:51.034Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (looking for help building internal tools for my company). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I have heard this term thrown around a lot in discussions on company specific forums online. People say that *xyz* company (for ex. google) has good internal tooling or *abc* has horrible outdated tooling (for ex. amazon).
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As someone who has never worked at any of the big tech companies, I have no idea what exactly are these 'internal tools' and how and why they are developed in the first place? Do other fortune 500 companies also develop their own tooling?
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Appreciate any help. Any examples of these 'tools' would be great. Thanks

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: Amazons internal tooling is pretty good, especially compared to most companies.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Bug reporting/management tool, IDEs, custom build and deployment systems, package management, etc.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: There are a lot of reasons to develop internal tools.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One of the examples is Google's code search. You have probably already seen it when building AOSP, or playing around with Chromium sources. There is a much more powerful internal version. There isn't any commercial alternatives back then (now there is SourceGraph), so building an internal tool is the only way to do it.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.456Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another is tight integration and customization for large repositories. Large companies sometimes have monorepos that are terabyte in size, and thousands of developers pushing code at any given time. So Git doesn't really cut it. And off the shelf perforce probably also doesn't work well.

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: What is company's internal tooling?
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: I have heard this term thrown around a lot in discussions on company specific forums online. People say that *xyz* company (for ex. google) has good internal tooling or *abc* has horrible outdated tooling (for ex. amazon).
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.459Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As someone who has never worked at any of the big tech companies, I have no idea what exactly are these 'internal tools' and how and why they are developed in the first place? Do other fortune 500 companies also develop their own tooling?
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Appreciate any help. Any examples of these 'tools' would be great. Thanks

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Amazons internal tooling is pretty good, especially compared to most companies.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Bug reporting/management tool, IDEs, custom build and deployment systems, package management, etc.

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a lot of reasons to develop internal tools.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One of the examples is Google's code search. You have probably already seen it when building AOSP, or playing around with Chromium sources. There is a much more powerful internal version. There isn't any commercial alternatives back then (now there is SourceGraph), so building an internal tool is the only way to do it.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Another is tight integration and customization for large repositories. Large companies sometimes have monorepos that are terabyte in size, and thousands of developers pushing code at any given time. So Git doesn't really cut it. And off the shelf perforce probably also doesn't work well.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Anything that is built in house and whose users are employees is called internal tooling. It can be an alternative to open source things like Google's Piper (version control for very large scale monorepo), it can be customer support software, it can be hiring software, it can be a CICD UI, it can be the orgchart website, it can be pretty much any piece of software that some sort of employee might need and that the company doesn't want to buy off-the-shelf for whatever reason (usually because there are custom requirements that commercial offerings can't do).

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >What is company's internal tooling?
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can't just "write code and run it". Even at the smallest company, you need giant piles of software and services to get anything done. Sometimes these are just an open source "tool chain" that you install, but more often they are hosted services. That can include:
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Where is code stored? (Github, Gitlab, etc)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.460Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Where are bugs files? (Github, JIRA, etc)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What CI/CD system? (Github, Jenkins, Travis, etc)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What linting systems do you use? (One for Docker vulnerabilities, one for your language 'best practices', one for scanning your infra, etc)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do you deploy? (GitOps like Flux)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do you do dark deploys? (LaunchDarkly, etc)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do you do monitoring? (Data Dog, Grafana hosting, AWS CloudWatch metrics)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do you log production errors? (Sentry, FullStory)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do people communicate? (Gmail, Slack)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do people document things? (Wiki, Notion, etc)

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Plus a dozen bespoke "internal tools" such as the slackbot that triggers a deploy, or the internal tool that tells you when the last deploy was, or the tool that subscribes to broadcasts that the coffee is ready,  etc.

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: looking for help building internal tools for my company.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.461Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.462Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:

[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T16:43:07.463Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.

Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (looking for help building internal tools for my company).

[2025-05-27T16:43:24.284Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.284Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. While some comments maintain a level of professionalism, especially when providing recommendations, the language is accessible and friendly. There is a sense of camaraderie among users, as they share experiences and advice.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.284Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.284Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments utilize **casual language** and occasionally include **technical jargon** related to Microsoft technologies (e.g., "Power Apps," "Dataverse," "SharePoint").
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.284Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There are instances of **direct address** (e.g., "you" and "your"), which creates a personal connection.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.284Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments include **abbreviations** (e.g., "ECM" for Enterprise Content Management) and **acronyms** (e.g., "M365" for Microsoft 365), which are common in tech discussions.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.284Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The use of phrases like "Totally get how overwhelming" and "Good luck with setting it up" reflects a supportive and understanding tone.

[2025-05-27T16:43:24.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am an intern for a small company, and we are trying to create a more centralized working environment for various teams and actions. We invested in Office 365 for simple reasons, but I am very intrigued by PowerApps, SharePoint, and anything that can help with automation. I strongly believe that setting up a centralized database and creating personalized tools would greatly help the business. I am trying to do that, but THERE ARE SO MANY SERVICES, AND IT IS ALL SO CONFUSING. I was looking at Sharepoint Frameworks and Azure Cosmos, but turns out there is no direct way to connect the two. Now I am looking at Dataverse and can't even figure out how to set up one database to play around with.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.286Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So my question is this: what Microsoft tech stack, or combination of services, do people in the industry use to build a more centralized, coherent digital working space for a company? Ideally, it should be fully customizable and have one centralized database that can be grown and expanded.

[2025-05-27T16:43:24.288Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/Office365
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.288Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >what Microsoft tech stack, or combination of services, do people in the industry use to build a more centralized, coherent digital working space for a company? Ideally, it should be fully customizable and have one centralized database that can be grown and expanded.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm confused as to what you're trying to solve for. Are you looking for a solution that allows collaboration across the organization or are you looking for a database to store data?
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you want clearer answers, ask clearer questions.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You basically ask: what do I need to make 'things'  more efficient, without specifying things.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Dokmee ECM is a versatile, secure content management solution suitable for businesses of all sizes
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Its user-friendly interface, available in 19 languages, streamlines document processes and enhances workflow efficiency with features like automated retention, searchable OCR, and robust security.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can schedule a demo on their website to see it in action. Highly recommended!

[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Totally get how overwhelming the Microsoft world can be so many pieces that do not always work well together. A lot of teams use Power Apps with Dataverse to build custom apps on a central database. SharePoint is good for documents and simple workflows but for more automation Power Automate usually helps out.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One tip is to keep your tools simple and focus on actual workflows instead of trying to build everything from scratch. Sometimes easy checklist and workflow tools like Manifestly can fit into your process without heavy development especially for task tracking and team handoffs. It is not a full database solution but if you want simple internal workflows it is worth a look.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Good luck with setting it up once you find the right combo it really helps smooth things out.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Take a look at the M365 fundamentals and Power Platform fundamentals certifications.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: looking for help building internal tools for my company.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.289Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (looking for help building internal tools for my company). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.
[2025-05-27T16:43:24.290Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Return as JSON:

[2025-05-27T16:43:40.952Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.953Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, especially in the second comment from the broker. The use of phrases like "talk to the people actually doing the work" and "that’s where the gold is" conveys a friendly and approachable demeanor. The first comment, while more formal due to its nature as a reminder from a bot, still maintains a straightforward and neutral tone, emphasizing community guidelines.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.953Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.953Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is generally **straightforward and accessible**, avoiding overly technical jargon in the broker's comment. The use of phrases like "nice to have" and "edge cases" indicates some familiarity with business terminology, but it is presented in a way that is easy to understand. The second comment includes a few grammatical errors and informal phrasing ("What we did we schedule"), which reflects a more casual and spontaneous style typical of online discussions.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.953Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.954Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with the first comment being relatively short and concise, while the broker's response is more detailed and elaborative. The broker's comment includes multiple sentences and structured advice, indicating a willingness to provide comprehensive insights, while the first comment is succinct and to the point.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.954Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:

When I’ve helped business owners prep for internal tools, especially before a sale or to tighten operations, we always start with one thing: talk to the people actually doing the work. Don’t assume you know the pain points. Sit with your team, watch how they work, and ask what slows them down. That’s where the gold is.

[2025-05-27T16:43:40.957Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.957Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.957Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, especially in the second comment from the broker. The use of phrases like "talk to the people actually doing the work" and "that’s where the gold is" conveys a friendly and approachable demeanor. The first comment, while more formal due to its nature as a reminder from a bot, still maintains a straightforward and neutral tone, emphasizing community guidelines.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.957Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is generally **straightforward and accessible**, avoiding overly technical jargon in the broker's comment. The use of phrases like "nice to have" and "edge cases" indicates some familiarity with business terminology, but it is presented in a way that is easy to understand. The second comment includes a few grammatical errors and informal phrasing ("What we did we schedule"), which reflects a more casual and spontaneous style typical of online discussions.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length, with the first comment being relatively short and concise, while the broker's response is more detailed and elaborative. The broker's comment includes multiple sentences and structured advice, indicating a willingness to provide comprehensive insights, while the first comment is succinct and to the point.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar in the first comment is **perfect and formal**, as expected from a bot-generated message. In contrast, the broker's comment employs a

[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.958Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing

[2025-05-27T16:43:40.959Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: looking for help building internal tools for my company.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.960Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention

[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.961Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.962Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T16:43:40.962Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (looking for help building internal tools for my company).

[2025-05-27T16:44:01.276Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. While some comments take on a more serious and analytical tone, particularly when discussing business strategies and SaaS (Software as a Service) concepts, the language remains accessible and relatable. There are elements of **encouragement and camaraderie**, especially in comments sharing personal experiences and successes.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a mix of **technical jargon** related to software development and business (e.g., "MVP," "B2C," "MRR," "no-code," "low-code"), indicating familiarity with the subject matter.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is also the use of **informal language and abbreviations**, such as "imo" (in my opinion) and "SaaS," which reflect a casual style.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments include **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "throwing shit at," "hit 2500 mrr") that contribute to a friendly, relatable atmosphere.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.277Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The length of the comments varies, but they generally tend to be **moderate to long**. Many comments provide detailed explanations, personal anecdotes, or structured arguments, often consisting of several sentences or bullet points. This reflects a willingness to engage deeply with the topic rather than providing superficial responses.

[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hello everyone!
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I recently watched a video from Rob Walling (link: [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDiboyl26w&t=4s&ab\_channel=MicroConf**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDiboyl26w&t=4s&ab_channel=MicroConf)) where he discussed building a SaaS company using no-code tools. I found it fascinating and wanted to know your thoughts on this topic.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Where do you think the limit is for no-code SaaS? Is it possible to build B2B software that can be sold to other companies or is it just suitable for creating internal tools that are not intended for the market?
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm curious about this approach and would love to hear about your experiences, opinions, and advice on this matter. Have you used no-code tools to build a successful SaaS product, and if so, what was your experience like? Do you have any recommendations or resources you could share?
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thank you in advance for your insights!

[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: During the gold rush, people selling the tools became rich than the ones seeking the gold.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: To build a first gen product to test the waters? Sure
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: To build for the future of a real company? Very unlikely.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I’m sure that for some simple, low volume products it can make sense, but for a SaaS company, where you literally sell software, you would be painting yourself in a corner.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I am, using Bubble. It's not quite what I'd call a successful business yet, but we're a little past $20K in 7 months, getting solid word of mouth already, and it's B2C, so it's looking good imo. This time next year it will likely be enough to focus on full time, sooner if I can secure funding. I've run into really just a couple challenges with using Bubble, but nothing that didn't have a workaround.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm really a marketer and CRO guy, not a programmer, so the choice of no-code was easy, and I picked it up well enough in a couple months to build out the MVP.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.278Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Scaling has been mostly fine, and the only hiccups were related to unoptimized workflows that I needed to improve, so I did. I don't know what you're thinking of building, but Bubble can handle some pretty complex stuff now. Might be worth looking into.

[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a mix of **technical jargon** related to software development and business (e.g., "MVP," "B2C," "MRR," "no-code," "low-code"), indicating familiarity with the subject matter.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is also the use of **informal language and abbreviations**, such as "imo" (in my opinion) and "SaaS," which reflect a casual style.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments include **colloquial expressions** (e.g., "throwing shit at," "hit 2500 mrr") that contribute to a friendly, relatable atmosphere.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The length of the comments varies, but they generally tend to be **moderate to long**. Many comments provide detailed explanations, personal anecdotes, or structured arguments, often consisting of several sentences or bullet points. This reflects a willingness to engage deeply with the topic rather than providing superficial responses.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL STYLE RULES:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write everything in lowercase (no capitals at all)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be super casual like "hey man", "tbh", "ngl", etc
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - include 1-2 small spelling mistakes per comment (like "thier" instead of "their", "definately" instead of "definitely")
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - present genuine pros and cons for all options
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - write like someone who's actually tried all 3 solutions
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - be honest about downsides of our solution too
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - never sound like marketing

[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: Is it Possible to Build a Successful SaaS Company with No-Code Tools? Seeking Opinions and Advice
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: Hello everyone!
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I recently watched a video from Rob Walling (link: [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDiboyl26w&t=4s&ab\_channel=MicroConf**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDiboyl26w&t=4s&ab_channel=MicroConf)) where he discussed building a SaaS company using no-code tools. I found it fascinating and wanted to know your thoughts on this topic.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Where do you think the limit is for no-code SaaS? Is it possible to build B2B software that can be sold to other companies or is it just suitable for creating internal tools that are not intended for the market?
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm curious about this approach and would love to hear about your experiences, opinions, and advice on this matter. Have you used no-code tools to build a successful SaaS product, and if so, what was your experience like? Do you have any recommendations or resources you could share?
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thank you in advance for your insights!
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.279Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Subreddit: r/SaaS
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Example comments from this thread:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: During the gold rush, people selling the tools became rich than the ones seeking the gold.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: To build a first gen product to test the waters? Sure
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: To build for the future of a real company? Very unlikely.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I’m sure that for some simple, low volume products it can make sense, but for a SaaS company, where you literally sell software, you would be painting yourself in a corner.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am, using Bubble. It's not quite what I'd call a successful business yet, but we're a little past $20K in 7 months, getting solid word of mouth already, and it's B2C, so it's looking good imo. This time next year it will likely be enough to focus on full time, sooner if I can secure funding. I've run into really just a couple challenges with using Bubble, but nothing that didn't have a workaround.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm really a marketer and CRO guy, not a programmer, so the choice of no-code was easy, and I picked it up well enough in a couple months to build out the MVP.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Scaling has been mostly fine, and the only hiccups were related to unoptimized workflows that I needed to improve, so I did. I don't know what you're thinking of building, but Bubble can handle some pretty complex stuff now. Might be worth looking into.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I think yes it's possible
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Some successful SaaS companies that have been built using no-code tools include Bubble, which offers a visual programming tool that enables users to create web and mobile apps without writing code
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you are interested in this I assume it’s because you have little coding experience but feel more comfortable in a marketing/sales/customer experience role. I am the same way. Instead of going no-code I just found a product that I felt aligned with the market I wanted to target. Then I found a company that offered white labeling. I put the website together and do all the marketing. But if a client has an issue, there is a fully staffed tech team that I can tap into if needed. It’s the best of both worlds IMO. I just hit 2500 mrr with only giving it very, very part time hours (talking like 5 hrs a week or less) and am looking forward to giving it more attention next quarter to grow it further once other contracts with my day gig wrap up.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: looking for help building internal tools for my company.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.280Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T16:44:01.281Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (looking for help building internal tools for my company). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T16:44:19.291Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.291Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, characteristic of Reddit discussions. While the subject matter is technical, the language is accessible and often direct, reflecting a community of practitioners sharing insights and experiences. There are elements of **frustration** and **concern** regarding the challenges of implementing DevOps practices, but also a sense of **collaboration** and **problem-solving**.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.291Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.291Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "DevOps," "IAC," "Kubernetes," "PR") and **informal expressions** (e.g., "in the shit," "get on zoom with them").
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.291Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - **Abbreviations** and acronyms are prevalent, indicating familiarity with the subject matter (e.g., EM for Engineering Manager, SRE for Site Reliability Engineer).
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.291Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There are instances of **slang** and colloquial phrases, such as "get on board," "tossed over the wall," and "grind it out," which contribute to the casual tone.

[2025-05-27T16:44:19.294Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: As soon as I read the words “management directed” the rest of the post became a “familiar” story. You cannot do devops in a top down way. Devops done right is like agile. The whole point is to satisfy all of the stakeholders (including whoever is providing the infrastructure, whether it’s AWS or Intel). If you aren’t constantly seeking and responding to the needs of your biggest stakeholder while building, you’re not gonna build the thing they need and they’ll hate it.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.294Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: >Then devs just say "no". There's no clear reasoning here, they don't say what is wrong or why they would refuse, they cannot point at any case that we do not cover and there is an easy and clear way of circumventing this system if you feel restricted
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.294Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It would have been a better situation if buy-in was achieved before this project started but there have clearly been some failures in your organization at the management and staff engineering level.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.294Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The EM/Staff on the ops side should have been reaching out to EM/Staff on the dev side to evangelize, gather early feedback, and set a course both sides of the house were happy with.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.294Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: First make another attempt to get those on board. The reality is usually only a few opinions actually matter because everyone looks to the same people to decide how they feel about something and if those folks are excited it will drive perception. Identify who those folks are and reach out to them.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.295Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If that fails, you're in the shit now but need to move forward.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.295Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You seem to have buy in from management, so repeat after me.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.295Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: "We are supporting the new platform. We are not supporting the old way where everyone did things dozens of different ways and then tossed the poorly executed infrastructure over the wall for someone to maintain. If you have concerns let's hear them, if you have ideas for improvements let's plan them, but this is how we're able to support infrastructure. "
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.295Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That's going to get ugly, so you need to bring some carrots with that stick and make the adoption smooth and pleasant.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.295Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: Next time someone submits a ticket for "stuff", get on zoom with them and show them how the tool works and having them drive while you talk.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.295Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Sometimes new tooling can be overwhelming and folks need additional support.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.295Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Maybe they want more insight into what's happening behind the UI. Is all of the code available in a repo they have access to? Maybe worried about monitoring or tracking?

Devops done right is like agile. The whole point is to satisfy all of the stakeholders (including whoever is providing the infrastructure, whether it’s AWS or Intel). If you aren’t constantly seeking and responding to the needs of your biggest stakeholder while building, you’re not gonna build the thing they need and they’ll hate it.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: >Then devs just say "no". There's no clear reasoning here, they don't say what is wrong or why they would refuse, they cannot point at any case that we do not cover and there is an easy and clear way of circumventing this system if you feel restricted
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It would have been a better situation if buy-in was achieved before this project started but there have clearly been some failures in your organization at the management and staff engineering level.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The EM/Staff on the ops side should have been reaching out to EM/Staff on the dev side to evangelize, gather early feedback, and set a course both sides of the house were happy with.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: First make another attempt to get those on board. The reality is usually only a few opinions actually matter because everyone looks to the same people to decide how they feel about something and if those folks are excited it will drive perception. Identify who those folks are and reach out to them.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If that fails, you're in the shit now but need to move forward.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You seem to have buy in from management, so repeat after me.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: "We are supporting the new platform. We are not supporting the old way where everyone did things dozens of different ways and then tossed the poorly executed infrastructure over the wall for someone to maintain. If you have concerns let's hear them, if you have ideas for improvements let's plan them, but this is how we're able to support infrastructure. "
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: That's going to get ugly, so you need to bring some carrots with that stick and make the adoption smooth and pleasant.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Next time someone submits a ticket for "stuff", get on zoom with them and show them how the tool works and having them drive while you talk.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Sometimes new tooling can be overwhelming and folks need additional support.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Maybe they want more insight into what's happening behind the UI. Is all of the code available in a repo they have access to? Maybe worried about monitoring or tracking?
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.297Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Someone in the SRE post mentioned asking the devs for their pain points before doing anything. You should have interviewed the devs and gotten a clear picture of what they needed.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also this should have been done in iterations, after planning you should have demoed it to the devs for feedback
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm guessing they are feeling like they don't want to deal with this shit and it's not part of their job & they didn't ask for it and they weren't involved in setting it up.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It was probably "working for them" to have no clue about any of this stuff & now their jobs are becoming significantly more complicated in a way that they could just break stuff they don't understand.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also a lot of people like to carve out a little comfort zone at work and just kind of grind it out in that comfort zone and anything that disrupts that will be met with hostility. I've seen a ton of devs who were super myopic about that. Literally couldn't care less if the world was on fire around them as long as their module "worked" (where worked means something like works in isolation & fuck the rest of the systems that interact with them).
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: looking for help building internal tools for my company.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.298Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (looking for help building internal tools for my company). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.
[2025-05-27T16:44:19.299Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Return as JSON:

[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I keep seeing questions about "How I make a model to answer based on my data. I have \[wiki, pdfs, whatever other documents\]"
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Currently I am making a living by helping companies built chatbots fine tuned on their custom data.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most of those are support or Q&A chatbots to answer questions from clients at any hour and day. There are also internal chatbots to be used to train new people joining the company and several other use cases.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So, I was thinking to share my experience (it might be wrong and I might be doing everything wrong, but it is my experience and based on this I have a dozen chatbots running in production and talking with clients with few dozen more in different stages of testing).
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The actual training / fine-tuning, while it might initially seem like a daunting task due to the plethora of tools available (FastChat, Axolot, Deepspeed, transformers, LoRA, qLoRA, and more), I must tell you - this is actually the easiest part of the whole process! All you need to do is peek into their repositories, grab an example, and tweak it to fit your model and data.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However, the real challenge lies in preparing the data. A massive wiki of product documentation, a thousand PDFs of your processes, or even a bustling support forum with countless topics - they all amount to nothing if you don't have your data in the right format. Projects like Dolly and Orca have shown us how enriching data with context or system prompts can significantly improve the final model's quality. Other projects, like Vicuna, use chains of multi-step Q&A with solid results. There are many other datasets formats, depending of the expected result. For example, a dataset for quotes is much simpler, because there will be no actual interaction, the quote is a quote.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Personally, I mostly utilize the #instruction, #input, #output format for most of my fine-tuning tasks.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So, shaping your data in the correct format is, without a doubt, the most difficult and time-consuming step when creating a Language Learning Model (LLM) for your company's documentation, processes, support, sales, and so forth.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Many methods can help you tackle this issue. Most choose to employ GPT4 for assistance. Privacy shouldn't be a concern if you're using Azure APIs, though they might be more costly, but offer privacy. However, if your data is incredibly sensitive, refrain from using them. And remember, any data used to train a public-facing chatbot should not contain any sensitive information.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Automated tools can only do so much; manual work is indispensable and in many cases, difficult to outsource. Those who genuinely understand the product/process/business should scrutinize and cleanse the data. Even if the data is top-notch and GPT4 does a flawless job, the training could still fail. For instance, outdated information or contradictory responses can lead to poor results.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In many of my projects, we involve a significant portion of the organization in the process. I develop a simple internal tool allowing individuals to review rows of training data and swiftly edit the output or flag the entire row as invalid.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Once you've curated and correctly formatted your data, the fine-tuning can commence. If you have a vast amount of data, i.e., tens of thousands of instructions, it's best to fine-tune the actual model. To do this, refer to the model repo and mimic their initial training process with your data.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However, if you're working with a smaller dataset, a LoRA or qLoRA fine-tuning would be more suitable. For this, start with examples from LoRA or qLoRA repositories, use booga UI, or experiment with different settings. Getting a good LoRA is a trial and error process, but with time, you'll become good at it.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Once you have your fine-tuned model, don't expose it directly to clients. Instead, run client queries through the model, showcasing the responses internally and inviting internal users to correct the answers. Depending on the percentage of responses modified by users, you might need to execute another fine-tuning with this new data or completely redo the fine-tuning if results were really poor.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: On the hardware front, while it's possible to train a qLoRA on a single 3090, I wouldn't recommend it. There are too many limitations, and even browsing the web while training could lead to OOM. I personally use a cloud A6000 with 48GB VRAM, which costs about 80 cents per hour.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For anything larger than a 13B model, whether it's LoRA or full fine-tuning, I'd recommend using A100. Depending on the model and dataset size, and parameters, I run 1, 4, or 8 A100s. Most tools are tested and run smoothly on A100, so it's a safe bet. I once got a good deal on H100, but the hassle of adapting the tools was too overwhelming, so I let it go.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Lastly, if you're looking for a quick start, try embeddings. This is a cheap, quick, and acceptable solution for internal needs. You just need to throw all internal documents into a vector db, put a model in front for searching, and voila! With no coding required, you can install booga with the superbooga extension to get started.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: &#x200B;
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: UPDATE:
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.745Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I saw some questions repeating, sorry that I am not able to answer to everyone, but I am updating here, hope that this helps. Here are some answers for the repeated questions:
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.746Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. I do not know how to train a pre-trained model with "raw" data, like big documents. From what I know, any further training of a pre-trained model is done by feeding data tokenized and padded to maximum context size of the original model,
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.746Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: no more.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.746Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Before starting, make sure that the problem that needs to be solved and the expectations are fully defined. "Teaching the model about xyz" is not a problem, it is a wish. It is hard to solve "wishes", but we can solve problems. For example: "I want to ask the model about xyz and get accurate answers based on abc data". This is needed to offer non stop answering chat for customers. We expect customer to ask "example1, 2, 3, .. 10" and we expect the answers to be in this style "example answers with example addressation, formal, informal, etc). We do not want the chat to engage in topics not related to xyz. If customer engage in such topics, politely explain that have no knowledge on that. (with example). This is a better description of the problem.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.746Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. It is important to define the target audience and how the model will be used. There is a big difference of using it internally inside an organisation or directly expose it to the clients. You can get a lot cheaper when it is just an internal helper and the output can be ignored if not good. For example, in this case, full documents can be ingested via vectordb and use the model to answer questions about the data from the vectordb. If you decide to go with the embeddings, this can be really helpful: [https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding](https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.746Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. It is important to define what is the expected way to interact with the model. Do you want to chat with it? Should it follow instructions? Do you want to provide a context and get output in the provided context? Do you want to complete your writing (like Github Copilot or Starcoder)? Do you want to perform specific tasks (eg grammar checking, translation, classification of something etc)?
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.746Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. After all the above are decided and clarified and you decided that embeddings are not what you want and want to proceed further with fine tuning, it is the time to decide on the data format.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.746Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. \#instruction,#input,#output is a popular data format and can be used to train for both chat and instruction following. This is an example dataset in this format: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned) . I am using this format the most because it is the easiest to format unstructured data into, having the optional #input it makes it very flexible
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.747Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. It was proven that having better structured, with extra information training data will produce better results. Here is Dolly dataset that is using a context to enrich the data: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.747Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A newer dataset that further proved that data format and quality is the most important in the output is Orca format. It is using a series of system prompts to categorize each data row (similar with a tagging system). [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.747Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. We don't need complicated data structure always. For example, if the expecation is that we prompt the model "Who wrote this quote: \[famous quote content\]?" and we expect to only get name of the author, then a simple format is enough, like it is here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Abirate/english\_quotes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Abirate/english_quotes)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.747Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. For a more fluid conversation, there is the Vicuna format, an Array of Q&A. Here is an example: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/wizard\_vicuna\_70k\_unfiltered](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/wizard_vicuna_70k_unfiltered)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.747Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 6. There are other datasets formats, in some the output is partially masked (for completion suggestion models), but I have not worked and I am not familiar with those formats.

[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**, typical of Reddit discussions. Users express enthusiasm and appreciation for tools and techniques, while also sharing personal experiences and insights. There is a sense of community and collaboration, particularly in the comments that suggest improvements or solutions.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature **technical jargon** related to machine learning and fine-tuning, such as "fine tuning," "LLM," "vector db," and "automated data integration."
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There are instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "SFTTrainer()") and references to specific tools and libraries (e.g., "HuggingFace"), indicating familiarity with the subject matter.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments include **casual phrases** like "stupidly simple" and "great work," which contribute to a relaxed atmosphere.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.748Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but are generally **medium to short**, with most being a few sentences long. This brevity is typical for online discussions, allowing for quick exchanges of ideas and information.

[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Title: My experience on starting with fine tuning LLMs with custom data
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Thread Content: I keep seeing questions about "How I make a model to answer based on my data. I have \[wiki, pdfs, whatever other documents\]"
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Currently I am making a living by helping companies built chatbots fine tuned on their custom data.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most of those are support or Q&A chatbots to answer questions from clients at any hour and day. There are also internal chatbots to be used to train new people joining the company and several other use cases.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So, I was thinking to share my experience (it might be wrong and I might be doing everything wrong, but it is my experience and based on this I have a dozen chatbots running in production and talking with clients with few dozen more in different stages of testing).
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The actual training / fine-tuning, while it might initially seem like a daunting task due to the plethora of tools available (FastChat, Axolot, Deepspeed, transformers, LoRA, qLoRA, and more), I must tell you - this is actually the easiest part of the whole process! All you need to do is peek into their repositories, grab an example, and tweak it to fit your model and data.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However, the real challenge lies in preparing the data. A massive wiki of product documentation, a thousand PDFs of your processes, or even a bustling support forum with countless topics - they all amount to nothing if you don't have your data in the right format. Projects like Dolly and Orca have shown us how enriching data with context or system prompts can significantly improve the final model's quality. Other projects, like Vicuna, use chains of multi-step Q&A with solid results. There are many other datasets formats, depending of the expected result. For example, a dataset for quotes is much simpler, because there will be no actual interaction, the quote is a quote.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Personally, I mostly utilize the #instruction, #input, #output format for most of my fine-tuning tasks.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So, shaping your data in the correct format is, without a doubt, the most difficult and time-consuming step when creating a Language Learning Model (LLM) for your company's documentation, processes, support, sales, and so forth.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Many methods can help you tackle this issue. Most choose to employ GPT4 for assistance. Privacy shouldn't be a concern if you're using Azure APIs, though they might be more costly, but offer privacy. However, if your data is incredibly sensitive, refrain from using them. And remember, any data used to train a public-facing chatbot should not contain any sensitive information.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Automated tools can only do so much; manual work is indispensable and in many cases, difficult to outsource. Those who genuinely understand the product/process/business should scrutinize and cleanse the data. Even if the data is top-notch and GPT4 does a flawless job, the training could still fail. For instance, outdated information or contradictory responses can lead to poor results.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: In many of my projects, we involve a significant portion of the organization in the process. I develop a simple internal tool allowing individuals to review rows of training data and swiftly edit the output or flag the entire row as invalid.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Once you've curated and correctly formatted your data, the fine-tuning can commence. If you have a vast amount of data, i.e., tens of thousands of instructions, it's best to fine-tune the actual model. To do this, refer to the model repo and mimic their initial training process with your data.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: However, if you're working with a smaller dataset, a LoRA or qLoRA fine-tuning would be more suitable. For this, start with examples from LoRA or qLoRA repositories, use booga UI, or experiment with different settings. Getting a good LoRA is a trial and error process, but with time, you'll become good at it.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Once you have your fine-tuned model, don't expose it directly to clients. Instead, run client queries through the model, showcasing the responses internally and inviting internal users to correct the answers. Depending on the percentage of responses modified by users, you might need to execute another fine-tuning with this new data or completely redo the fine-tuning if results were really poor.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: On the hardware front, while it's possible to train a qLoRA on a single 3090, I wouldn't recommend it. There are too many limitations, and even browsing the web while training could lead to OOM. I personally use a cloud A6000 with 48GB VRAM, which costs about 80 cents per hour.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For anything larger than a 13B model, whether it's LoRA or full fine-tuning, I'd recommend using A100. Depending on the model and dataset size, and parameters, I run 1, 4, or 8 A100s. Most tools are tested and run smoothly on A100, so it's a safe bet. I once got a good deal on H100, but the hassle of adapting the tools was too overwhelming, so I let it go.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Lastly, if you're looking for a quick start, try embeddings. This is a cheap, quick, and acceptable solution for internal needs. You just need to throw all internal documents into a vector db, put a model in front for searching, and voila! With no coding required, you can install booga with the superbooga extension to get started.

[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: UPDATE:
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.749Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I saw some questions repeating, sorry that I am not able to answer to everyone, but I am updating here, hope that this helps. Here are some answers for the repeated questions:
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.750Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. I do not know how to train a pre-trained model with "raw" data, like big documents. From what I know, any further training of a pre-trained model is done by feeding data tokenized and padded to maximum context size of the original model, no more.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.750Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Before starting, make sure that the problem that needs to be solved and the expectations are fully defined. "Teaching the model about xyz" is not a problem, it is a wish. It is hard to solve "wishes", but we can solve problems. For example: "I want to ask the model about xyz and get accurate answers based on abc data". This is needed to offer non stop answering chat for customers. We expect customer to ask "example1, 2, 3, .. 10" and we expect the answers to be in this style "example answers with example addressation, formal, informal, etc). We do not want the chat to engage in topics not related to xyz. If customer engage in such topics, politely explain that have no knowledge on that. (with example). This is a better description of the problem.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.750Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. It is important to define the target audience and how the model will be used. There is a big difference of using it internally inside an organisation or directly expose it to the clients. You can get a lot cheaper when it is just an internal helper and the output can be ignored if not good. For example, in this case, full documents can be ingested via vectordb and use the model to answer questions about the data from the vectordb. If you decide to go with the embeddings, this can be really helpful: [https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding](https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.750Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. It is important to define what is the expected way to interact with the model. Do you want to chat with it? Should it follow instructions? Do you want to provide a context and get output in the provided context? Do you want to complete your writing (like Github Copilot or Starcoder)? Do you want to perform specific tasks (eg grammar checking, translation, classification of something etc)?
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.750Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. After all the above are decided and clarified and you decided that embeddings are not what you want and want to proceed further with fine tuning, it is the time to decide on the data format.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.750Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. \#instruction,#input,#output is a popular data format and can be used to train for both chat and instruction following. This is an example dataset in this format: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned) . I am using this format the most because it is the easiest to format unstructured data into, having the optional #input it makes it very flexible
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.750Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. It was proven that having better structured, with extra information training data will produce better results. Here is Dolly dataset that is using a context to enrich the data
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.751Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: : [https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.751Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A newer dataset that further proved that data format and quality is the most important in the output is Orca format. It is using a series of system prompts to categorize each data row (similar with a tagging system). [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.751Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. We don't need complicated data structure always. For example, if the expecation is that we prompt the model "Who wrote this quote: \[famous quote content\]?" and we expect to only get name of the author, then a simple format is enough, like it is here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Abirate/english\_quotes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Abirate/english_quotes)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.751Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. For a more fluid conversation, there is the Vicuna format, an Array of Q&A. Here is an example: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/wizard\_vicuna\_70k\_unfiltered](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/wizard_vicuna_70k_unfiltered)
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.751Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 6. There are other datasets formats, in some the output is partially masked (for completion suggestion models), but I have not worked and I am not familiar with those formats.
[2025-05-27T16:44:38.751Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 6. From my experiments, things that can be totally wrong:

[2025-05-27T16:44:53.148Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.148Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.148Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. The users are sharing suggestions and experiences in a friendly manner, which is typical of Reddit discussions. There is a sense of community and willingness to help, as evidenced by the offers for assistance and recommendations.
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.149Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.149Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward and technical, often incorporating industry-specific jargon related to AI and chatbots (e.g., "API," "data scrapping," "self-hosted").
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.149Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is a mix of **abbreviations** (e.g., "DM" for direct message, "M365" for Microsoft 365) and **acronyms** (e.g., "FAQ," "AI").
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.149Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments use **casual phrases** like "just try" or "let me know," which contribute to the informal tone.
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.149Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.149Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but are generally **concise**, typically ranging from one to three sentences. They provide enough information to be helpful without overwhelming the reader.
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.149Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.149Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar is mostly **casual**, with some comments featuring incomplete sentences or informal structures (e.g., "Help me, or help me find the people"). There are occasional grammatical errors or typos, but the overall clarity of the message is maintained.

[2025-05-27T16:44:53.150Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. The users are sharing suggestions and experiences in a friendly manner, which is typical of Reddit discussions. There is a sense of community and willingness to help, as evidenced by the offers for assistance and recommendations.
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.150Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.150Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward and technical, often incorporating industry-specific jargon related to AI and chatbots (e.g., "API," "data scrapping," "self-hosted").
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.151Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There is a mix of **abbreviations** (e.g., "DM" for direct message, "M365" for Microsoft 365) and **acronyms** (e.g., "FAQ," "AI").
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.151Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments use **casual phrases** like "just try" or "let me know," which contribute to the informal tone.

[2025-05-27T16:44:53.153Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: looking for help building internal tools for my company.
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.153Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.154Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: solution
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.155Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.156Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.157Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.157Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.157Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.157Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.157Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.157Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T16:44:53.157Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (looking for help building internal tools for my company).
