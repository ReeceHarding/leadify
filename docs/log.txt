[2025-05-27T18:26:43.978Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.978Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.979Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informative and pragmatic**. Most comments aim to provide practical advice and insights regarding software development and hiring practices. There is a mix of **casual** and **professional** tones, with some comments being more conversational and others adopting a more formal approach, especially when discussing technical aspects or recommendations.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.979Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.979Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language patterns include a mix of **technical jargon** (e.g., "full stack developer," "devops," "QA") and **everyday language**. Some comments use **slang** or informal phrases (e.g., "sense BS," "love this exploratory phase"), while others maintain a more straightforward and professional vocabulary. Abbreviations like "PM" (project management) and "CTO" (Chief Technology Officer) are also present, indicating familiarity with industry terms.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.979Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.979Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comments vary in length but tend to be **moderate to long**. Many responses provide detailed explanations, often breaking down complex ideas into manageable sections (e.g., outlining options A, B, and C). This suggests a willingness to engage deeply with the topic rather than providing surface-level responses.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.979Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.979Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual** but still coherent. While some comments contain minor grammatical errors or informal structures, they are mostly understandable. Punctuation

[2025-05-27T18:26:43.980Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.980Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world.

[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a handful of things you need to consider: how involved do you want to be? How much $ do you want to invest? What is your tolerance for risk? And, where is your expertise? Then you have a few options.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A: offshore team or staff augmentation:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you know exactly what you want to have done and you can build a roadmap, hold a team accountable to their deliverables, sense BS in a technical setting, then this is a good option. You can save money going this route if you have a somewhat time-boxed project, but you need strong management and very strong communication and product direction. This may be less expensive but
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: it costs your time and you need to know what you want.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: B. Hire an engineer:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It sounds like you would need to hire a Jack-of-all-trades full stack developer, and an employee of course needs management support and resources to thrive in their role. Look for someone who has experience in a few different tech stacks and languages. Expect to pay a relatively high salary for someone with experience in architecture design, team leadership, devops and systems integration. I love these people but they can be difficult to find. Lots of engineers _think_ they are like this, but it’s a special person who can fill the role of the first/only software developer at a growing company in a competitive field. This is a great longer term choice that produces good quality custom work if you find the right fit, but you need solid management and goals in place or this will frustrate you very much. You’ll also need to hire more engineers down the road, need a plan for software testing, build tech policies, all that.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: C. Hire a 3rd party company.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Search for “digital innovation” or “custom software” or look at “beaugmented.ai” and ask to set up an intro call. These firms can build a team of the right types of engineers, developers, managers, qa, product people and designers that fits your needs and stays in your budget. They will work with you to define exactly what you want and tell you what to expect in terms of timelines and roadmaps, they should be able to help you get to a small, working project and grow from there as your company grows. They will care about making you money because they should understand your business needs. This may be an expensive option upfront but it will get you to your goal faster and much better, especially if you don’t have a cto or technical team in-house. Unless you plan to build out a whole software team internally (at least 4 people) then this is usually the best way.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Again, I’d love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!

[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It depends on how complex your needs are.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I would recommend against just hiring a solitary programmer and expecting the moon. First, likely the programmer has gaps in their knowledge. If not, they are likely either very expensive or very inexperienced (and faking it). Finally, having someone test their own work is bad practice.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire.
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.983Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:

[2025-05-27T18:26:43.984Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.984Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.984Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.984Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:26:43.984Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons

[2025-05-27T18:26:58.358Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.358Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.358Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly **casual and conversational**. Participants share personal experiences and insights in a friendly manner, often using first-person narratives. There is an undercurrent of **pragmatism**, as many comments focus on practical advice and lessons learned from hiring developers. Some comments also exhibit a tone of **caution**, especially regarding the unpredictability of freelance platforms.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.358Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.358Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature a mix of **informal language** and **industry jargon**. Slang terms like "hit or miss" and phrases like "you get what you are paying for" are common. Abbreviations such as "FWIW" (for what it's worth) and "IDLE" (from the context of game development) are also present. The use of **direct address** (e.g., "Cheers to all!") adds to the casual feel, making it seem like a conversation among peers.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.358Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.358Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, but many are **moderately long**, often consisting of several paragraphs.

[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Here are some options I am considering:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Upwork, Fiverr
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Google
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Asking around on social media..?
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: Figure out what "good" means for your team - seniority, specific languages? Having that clear vision, our CEO consulted with Lemon.io, and kudos to them. It went stress-free all the way. Hope your experience is just as easy
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: When I want to hire someone, I usually find them through Reddit, I go into subs specific for what I need to hire, then I look for the person who adds the most value via comments. I reach out to 10-15 redditors and usually hire from there.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.359Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: It has never failed me in over 40 hires.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I used Fiverr to make a simple CLICKER/IDLE game and the cost was 1,500 USD with all set up and running in the GooglePlayStore.  As many people have mentioned using Fivver is a " Hit or Miss" as dar as quality development.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My experience working with the Developer from Fivver was not bad but you will have to look at many portfolios and try ask questions to decipher WHO , appears to have the knowledge to bring to life your project.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I can say that price range varies and its backed by the developer's experience for the most part. I seen some work that I liked but the prices are based on same great work. I am onna budget so I went with basically one of the cheapest  developer's for my project.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Things to keep in mind... you get what you are paying for literally. The European and Americans appear to charge the most because of skills and so I opted to go with a cheaper PAKISTANI developer.  Things to keep in mind if opting for cheaper routes.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: TIME ZONE DIFFERENCE: I had free time between the hours of 2am till 5am and in Pakistan it was afternoon,  so this worked out well in my case.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: LANGUAGE BARRIER: during vetting process asking questions will allow to get a feel for the developer's English speaking and compression. My developer was having poor grammar in English but made up for it with SUPER quick responses and example; when I logged into game I can then say hey man you spelled these words wrong , spell it like this.....he would quickly go and fix spelling so language for me was not a huge issue.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: WORK ETHIC  : here is where things get dicey and basically I recommend to break your project down in sections or Phases. Example;  when I spieled my apps plan and gameplay he quoted me 1,500 dollars and I agreed. Next I broke the apps vision in 3 phases.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: PAYMENT: I used the in app Fiverr payment system and everything was fine. I paid 500 dollars and gave developer EXACTLY what I wished for...... after 1 week he produced the results then asked me for a revision  or 2 and when I was happy I then pay him 500 dollars in Fiverr for Phase 2 then 500 for final phase 3
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Conclusion; I would use service again but my game was Idle/clicker very easy. These 3 sections  I completed basically completes  CHAPTER/PHASE  1 of the entire game that when finished will take another 2 phases. Its important to have EVERYTHING ready for these low price developer's because the price point will not allow them to be or want to be creative and spend more time than they have to on your project and therefore being ready and knowing exactly what you want is key.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Last advise, in last phase and last revisions TAKE YOUR TIME trying to find bugs. Click on everything,  enjoy game, reset and basically tinker ,tinker , tinker to find as many bugs for it to be fixed in final and ultimate revision.  I failed this step and it will cost me about 2 or 3 hundred dollars to fix. Example of bug I did not catch during revision ; when you scuba dive to collect gold then when you upgrade the TILE to level 2 the tile would change to a more advanced TILE but the ( bug) I did not catch was that the ( Level marker still would say LEVEL 1 TILE instead of changing to LEVEL 2 because the tile was upgraded and looks better and nicer but it would still say underneath Level 1
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: All in all, its doable to make a low price app on Fivver but you must know ALL details and have alot patience as most Devs are foreign speaking languages.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.360Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Cheers to all !

[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Most things on Fiverr are a crap shoot. Upwork can be the same but maybe a bit better. I would always suggest looking over the developers portfolio and asking them about the process they use. Things like how the workflow works. This can be a quick way to weed out some of the bottom tier developers.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What are you looking to develop? I may be able to give you better direction on where to look.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ---
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What's your budget or the assumed budget of the competition? Above a certain budget I'd think you'd want to find a vendor or shop instead of dealing with independent contractors on sites like upwork. FWIW depending on the scope of your project I'd say look on subreddits like experienced devs.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.361Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comme
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: nt:
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:26:58.362Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T18:27:13.083Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for.

[2025-05-27T18:27:13.083Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. The commenters use a friendly and approachable style, making it easy for readers to engage with the content. There is an underlying sense of helpfulness as they share advice and resources.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature **casual language**, including the use of phrases like "I mean," "you know," and "tons of people," which contribute to a laid-back tone.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - There are also **abbreviations and acronyms** common in the tech and gaming communities, such as "Discord," "Unity," and "Upwork."
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Some comments include **slang** (e.g., "meddle," "gig developer") and playful elements (e.g., "if you can pay them fairly for it ;P"), which add to the informal nature.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length but generally tend to be **medium to long**. They provide detailed information, including multiple options and explanations, which reflects a desire to be thorough and helpful.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is **casual and conversational** rather than formal. While the comments are mostly coherent and structured, they often include incomplete sentences or phrases that mimic spoken language. This style enhances the informal tone and makes the advice feel more personal and relatable
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== THREAD CONTENT ==========
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Just to clarify, I'm not recruiting anyone on this thread, so I don't think it necessarily breaks the 'no soliciting employment' rule. I will also not be responding to any self-promotions in comments or DM's via Reddit, though if you can recommend a good dev through a reputable site that's different.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm just curious what the best place to find reputable programmers to hire is for working on games. My project is pretty big in scope, and while I am somewhat decent at coding, I'm more of the design/animation etc guy and would ideally like to hire a programmer, or maybe even two, to help me work on the core framework of my game to get it done in a reasonable amount of time.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'm ideally looking for something where I can hire someone that I can work *with,* being able to review and go over stuff that is being developed, as opposed to paying someone to go off and make something for me without any input or consultation during the development process. Preferably something where a dev would be open to being hired again in the future to fix bugs, add new content etc as well.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I know this will be pretty damn expensive, like easily in five figures, as it's a full-scale game I'm working on and I still have a few months of saving I need to do before I'm ready to actually hire anyone, but I'm just trying to get to know my options and possibly even talk to a few programmers who could provide consultations, advice on developing a game design document and so on.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Any advice is appreciated, and again I want to emphasize that ***I will not be responding to any self-promoting Reddit DM's or comments!*** If you would like to recommend a specific dev or something, I'm looking to see reputable portfolios and sites that will handle the commission etc.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I mean, it definitely can be tricky finding platforms that let you work directly with engineers while handling commissions and other mundane stuff. Look into some guys like Lemon.io, who clearly state that they won’t meddle with day-to-day work. So far, no issues for me
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: You've got quite a few options really:
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * You can check out /r/ForHire and the more gaming industry focused /r/GameDevClassifieds. Tons of people are there but the main issue is that you'll have to deal with the logistics and legality on your own. It is free to post of course.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * There are some Discords that freelance game devs frequent such as [Game Dev League](https://discord.com/invite/0TYNJfCU4De7YIk8), the official [Unity Discord](https://discord.com/invite/unity) (if you're going to use Unity) and the most popular [Unreal Discord](https://discord.com/invite/unreal-slackers). Same as the above, legality and logistics are your own.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * There is [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) that is more geared towards freelance work but works as well for long term contracts. The website is setup so it takes care of logistics and some of the legalities for you. It is free to post the job but you may need to pay a percentage when paying the freelancer (depending on the agreement, either the freelancer will load it up in the price he is quoting or will eat it instead).
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.084Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * There is also [WorkWithIndies](https://www.workwithindies.com/) and [RemoteGameJobs](https://remotegamejobs.com/) but there is a fee (usually ~$50 one time payment) to post there. This is more geared towards traditional hiring processes.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.085Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you are serious about this and can pay industry standards -- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is a good one. Free to post and to hire but the extra "recruiting stuff" (i.e. advertising, sponsoring, etc...) is paid.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.085Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Finally, you can get a little bit creative (especially if you have the money for it) and reach out to reputable outsourcing companies. Though these are going to probably cost you quite a lot. I heard of a couple [Cathar Games](https://www.cathargames.com/en/index.html) (for clarity, I know the founder and we used to chat a lot a few years ago) and [Streamline Studios](https://www.streamline-studios.com/) (for clarity, an ex-colleague of mine knows them and if I recall correctly his previous company worked with them).
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.085Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: With this description it sounds like you're looking for actual career oriented professionals and not your average gig developer. That is going to be very expensive. To give you an idea I would not do that contract for less than $50 an hour, assuming you don't provide typical benefits. So for two full time engineers you're looking at around 200k a year, give or take. To find those kinds of guys you should be posting on actual job boards like LinkedIn.

[2025-05-27T18:27:13.087Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.087Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.087Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.087Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.087Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.087Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.087Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: .
[2025-05-27T18:27:13.088Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T18:27:29.968Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.969Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overall tone of the comments is **informative and supportive**. The commenters aim to provide practical advice and share personal experiences, which creates a helpful atmosphere. While the language is straightforward and professional, it maintains a casual feel, making it accessible to a wide audience.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.969Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.969Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The language used is predominantly **conversational** and **direct**. There are some instances of technical jargon related to app development (e.g., "MVP," "tech stack," "React Native"), but these terms are explained or contextualized, making them understandable for readers who may not be familiar with them. The use of phrases like "you can start looking" and "I would suggest" indicates a collaborative and encouraging approach. There is minimal use of slang or abbreviations, keeping the language clear and professional.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.969Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Typical Comment Length
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.969Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The comments vary in length but generally fall within the **medium to long range**. They provide enough detail to convey useful information without overwhelming the reader. The first comment is the longest, as it outlines a structured approach to developing an app, while other comments are shorter but still informative.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.969Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Grammar Style
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.969Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The grammar style is mostly **casual but coherent**. While the comments are not overly formal, they maintain a level of professionalism. There are some minor grammatical imperfections (e.g., missing commas or informal sentence structures), but they do not detract from the clarity of the message. The use of bullet points or lists is absent

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:27:29.970Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: I would suggest you make a document/slides that would explain your idea. What you are trying to solve, who are your target customers, references the developer can look at to understand how this idea works (if there are existing apps that are already doing your idea), and what features you are thinking of to be part of the MVP.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.970Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then you can start looking for developers that can help you make the idea into reality.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.970Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you are thinking of making the app available for both Android and iOS, I would suggest looking for Mobile Developers who knows React Native, a framework that allows developers to use the same code to publish apps for both Android and iOS.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.970Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can look for developers via LinkedIn, Upwork, Fiverr, or just googling. Posting on subreddits like this helps as well.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.970Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: I found my developers on Upwork after posting a detailed description of what I want + provided design
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.970Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I think the wireframes or low quality design is great to the success of any project before engaging developers or even designers. You will be surprised how many times you will change your mind about some features/layouts.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.970Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For me to de-risk the process I got a UX guy to do the designs for the app (paid them $15/hour) and I got a specialist to advise on the best "Tech stack" so I won't be taken on a ride with the developers.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.970Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: From my experience developers work better if you provide your design. Adobe XD is free and it has free templates that you can use, so get started. There are plenty of other wireframing/prototype apps out there that you can also use.

[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:

[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar is

[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:27:29.972Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention

[2025-05-27T18:27:42.619Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products.

Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:27:42.620Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hi, I am leading a small team of 4 people and we was developing a small workflow automation tool. Unfortunately our lead developer had to part way from us for certain reasons. Apparently he wanted to begin his venture. It was quite sad for me but I figured that I should respect his decision.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.620Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: For that reason I am planning to find a new developer. But that COVID-19 situation made me unable to meet new people in person. Then I decided to try hiring freelancers but honestly I am not sure if it would work well.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.620Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I used to hire a freelance designer via Fiverr to help designing a logo. But that is too different than hiring a developers. Therefore I would like to ask if there is anyone has hired freelance developer before?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.620Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I wish to know where is the good source to find quality developers. And also what should I pay attention to when hiring freelance developers?

[2025-05-27T18:27:42.620Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Hiring Development resources is tough, and getting scammed or ripped off is pretty easy on sites such as Fiverr or Upwork.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.620Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I'd suggest going through an agency and getting a dedicated vetted engineer for your team. Not as cheap, but much higher quality and over site.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.620Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Disclaimers: I started 3 startups with that model, and now I run an agency that provides that after seeing how it worked with us. PM me if you need more info.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: If you're not technical yourself then it'll be very hard for you to judge the competency of developer, especially if they're not honest with you. The best thing that you can do it to require them to provide references for previous clients who they've done similar work for, and then to speak to those clients about their experience with the developers.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Some questions you can ask to try and identify the difference between proper developers and people who can write code (although be aware that if you don't understand these concept, they can probably just BS you):
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What development methodology do they follow?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do they manage source control?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Do they use tests as part of the development process?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How do they backup their code?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What documentation will they provide alongside the code?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What secure development practices do they use?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: One of the biggest issues is a mismatch in expectations between the two sides when outsourcing development. Before speaking to them, you need to be clear on:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What are your functional requirements?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What are your non-functional requirements?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you verify that the developed software meets these requirements?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What is are your deadlines (and are they realistic)?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What is your budget?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What happens if the project goes overbudget or overtime? Are you paying per hour, or a fixed price for the work?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What happens if you make changes to the original design or what additional features added?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Do you require ongoing support, or do they deliver the tool and then you're done?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What about fixing bugs?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Will your receive the source code alongside the working tools? What about documentation, build scripts and instructions, etc?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * What level of security do you need for the tool? How will the developers provide this? If it needs third party testing, who will pay?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.622Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will the delivery process work? Will you get given the software at the end of the process, or will they provide incremental version updates so you can test them as you go (such as using an Agile development process).
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.623Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you monitor progress throughout the project to ensure that it's on track?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.623Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * How will you pay them? Upfront? Once the project is completed? In stages when they meet specific milestones?
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.623Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You should also be very cautious of outsourcing development to India/Bangladesh/etc. The prices will look much cheaper up front, but while I'm sure there are some very good developers out there, you generally get what you pay for. I've seen companies "save" a fortune by outsourcing development to India, and then 12 months down the line having to write off the entire project and start from scratch because what was delivered was fundamentally unfit for purpose. I'm not saying that it can't work out well, but if you're not technical then it's going to be very easy for them to pull the wool over your eyes and BS you.

[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: There are a lot of places, ranging from /r/forhire to the tech slacks to the job sites like Indeed. But that's not really the tricky part. I have a company that finds developers for entrepreneurs, including freelance and remote, and it's not so much a matter of where you go to get developers as the kind of screening you do. That's basically what I'm getting paid for; although I have some pro places to find developers, really, my value added is that I'm good at telling if a candidate is the right fit. So here's the sort of things you should do:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * If you post a job ad, ask the candidate questions that make it clear whether they actually looked at what the job was. There are freelancers who just respond to every listing out there without even reading them. You don’t want them.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Be clear about what you want the candidate to do. It's non uncommon for a candidate to accept a job that isn't what they're good at because they misunderstood what the employer was looking for.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Ask for examples of previous work. Pay attention to the stuff that is as close as possible to what you want them to do.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * When you look at someone's previous work, focus on the details. How dedicated are they to getting the job done right? A hard worker who follows best practices beats out a sloppy genius.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Don't go for the cheapest guy. There's a reason why he's the cheapest guy. Similarly, if you offer a really low hourly rate, you'll be disappointed by who applies for the opening.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * Attitude matters. If a candidate is acting like a jerk or being continually late with their responses when they haven't even been hired yet, they're not going to improve once they've gotten the job.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hope this helps!

[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Try upwork
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.625Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.626Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casua
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: l mention
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.627Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.628Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.628Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.628Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.628Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.628Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:27:42.628Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T18:27:57.208Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.208Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.208Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **casual and conversational**. The use of informal language and direct address to the reader creates an approachable atmosphere. There’s a sense of camaraderie among commenters, as they share personal experiences and advice.
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.208Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.208Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments feature **slang and colloquial expressions** (e.g., "being a shit lately," "drain the money from you"). Abbreviations like "DM" (direct message) and "SAAS" (Software as a Service) are used, indicating familiarity with tech jargon. The use of phrases like "find a guy or a team" reflects a straightforward and informal approach to communication.
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.209Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.209Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, but they tend to be **moderate to short**. Most comments are concise, often consisting of a few sentences that get straight to the point. This brevity is typical in online discussions where users prefer quick exchanges of information.

[2025-05-27T18:27:57.209Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is predominantly **casual**. While some comments are relatively well-structured, others contain grammatical errors, incomplete sentences, or informal punctuation (e.g., lack of capitalization at the beginning of sentences). This reflects a relaxed writing style common in online forums.
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.209Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 5. **How People Give Recommendations**:

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:27:57.213Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.213Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)

[2025-05-27T18:27:57.215Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.215Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:27:57.215Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.

[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **professional yet casual**. The commenters are engaging in a business-related discussion while maintaining a friendly and approachable demeanor. Phrases like "Let’s get in touch" and "Happy to talk!" contribute to a welcoming atmosphere.
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is predominantly **straightforward and direct**, with a focus on clarity. There are some instances of informal language, such as "dm" (direct message) and "let’s" which suggest a casual approach. However, the use of terms like "reasonable price" and "source Devs" indicates a familiarity with industry jargon.
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being quite brief (e.g., "What’s a reasonable price to you?") and others more detailed (e.g., the comment about working on frontend and backend). On average, the comments are moderately long, providing enough information to convey interest and expertise without being overly verbose.
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.812Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual**, with some comments containing minor grammatical errors or informal constructions (e.g., "I m a dev" instead of "I'm a dev"). This reflects a conversational tone typical of online discussions, where strict adherence to grammar rules is often relaxed.

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:28:15.819Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire.
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.819Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.820Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, s
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ome alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.821Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.822Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:28:15.822Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.

[2025-05-27T18:28:36.992Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.992Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, with a mix of skepticism and critical analysis. Commenters express doubt and question the validity of the data presented, indicating a tone that is both inquisitive and somewhat confrontational. There is also a hint of sarcasm in some comments, particularly in the use of phrases like "Aint skurred," which suggests a casual dismissal of concerns.
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.992Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.992Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language patterns include **informal expressions and colloquialisms**. For instance, the use of "Aint skurred" reflects a relaxed, conversational style. Additionally, there are instances of technical jargon related to the software engineering field, such as "O*NET occupation codes" and specific job titles. Abbreviations like "ADP" are used without explanation, assuming a certain level of familiarity with the subject matter among readers.
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.992Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.992Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being quite concise (a few sentences) while others are more detailed and analytical (several sentences to a paragraph). The length often correlates with the complexity of the point being made; more technical or analytical comments tend to be longer.
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.992Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.992Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**. While some comments maintain a degree of structure and coherence, others exhibit informal grammar, such as

So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is predominantly **informal and conversational**, with a mix of skepticism and critical analysis. Commenters express doubt and question the validity of the data presented, indicating a tone that is both inquisitive and somewhat confrontational. There is also a hint of sarcasm in some comments, particularly in the use of phrases like "Aint skurred," which suggests a casual dismissal of concerns.
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language patterns include **informal expressions and colloquialisms**. For instance, the use of "Aint skurred" reflects a relaxed, conversational style. Additionally, there are instances of technical jargon related to the software engineering field, such as "O*NET occupation codes" and specific job titles. Abbreviations like "ADP" are used without explanation, assuming a certain level of familiarity with the subject matter among readers.
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The comments vary in length, with some being quite concise (a few sentences) while others are more detailed and analytical (several sentences to a paragraph). The length often correlates with the complexity of the point being made; more technical or analytical comments tend to be longer.
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**. While some comments maintain a degree of structure and coherence, others exhibit informal grammar, such as

[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: >To identify software developers in the ADP sample, we independently matched two criteria, job titles and O*NET occupation codes, followed by review and filtering of the results. A set of employees was identified by querying a set of keywords present in known software developer job titles (such as software engineer, C++ developer, stack developer) and querying O*NET occupation codes for software developers (15-1252.00, 15-1253.00, 15-1254.00 and 15-1221.00). Combined data resulting from these queries was manually reviewed to weed out any job titles captured erroneously. Because the list of resulting job titles was quite long, a rule of thumb was applied to job titles that occur fewer than 2,500 times. These had to contain the key words “software” or “developer” to be included in the sample
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.993Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I doubt this captures everything, because businesses won't always hire "software developers". My position is considered "programmer/application analyst", and unless that's within their predefined wording, it might not even be captured correctly.

[2025-05-27T18:28:36.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:28:36.995Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire).

[2025-05-27T18:28:46.654Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: ### Analysis of Reddit Comments
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.654Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.655Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. While the discussions touch on serious topics related to remote work and cultural differences, the language used is approachable and lacks the rigidity of formal discourse. The comments reflect a mix of **frustration and pragmatism**, particularly regarding challenges faced in international collaborations.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.655Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.655Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward, with occasional use of **colloquial expressions** and phrases that suggest a casual familiarity with the subject matter. There are instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "PRs" for pull requests, "EST" for Eastern Standard Time) and **technical jargon** relevant to the software development field. Some comments also use lists (e.g., bullet points) to organize thoughts, which is common in online discussions for clarity.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.655Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.655Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, but they tend to be **moderate to long**. Many comments provide detailed insights and personal experiences, often spanning several sentences or paragraphs. This length allows for nuanced discussions, especially when addressing complex issues like communication barriers and cultural differences.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.656Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.656Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**, with some comments featuring minor grammatical errors or typos (e.g., "durring" instead of "during"). This reflects a more relaxed approach to writing, typical of online forums

[2025-05-27T18:28:46.658Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:28:46.658Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. **Overall Tone**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.658Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The overall tone of the comments is **informal and conversational**. While the discussions touch on serious topics related to remote work and cultural differences, the language used is approachable and lacks the rigidity of formal discourse. The comments reflect a mix of **frustration and pragmatism**, particularly regarding challenges faced in international collaborations.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.658Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. **Common Language Patterns**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.658Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The language is straightforward, with occasional use of **colloquial expressions** and phrases that suggest a casual familiarity with the subject matter. There are instances of **abbreviations** (e.g., "PRs" for pull requests, "EST" for Eastern Standard Time) and **technical jargon** relevant to the software development field. Some comments also use lists (e.g., bullet points) to organize thoughts, which is common in online discussions for clarity.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.658Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. **Typical Comment Length**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.658Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Comment lengths vary, but they tend to be **moderate to long**. Many comments provide detailed insights and personal experiences, often spanning several sentences or paragraphs. This length allows for nuanced discussions, especially when addressing complex issues like communication barriers and cultural differences.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.658Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 4. **Grammar Style**:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The grammar style is generally **casual and conversational**, with some comments featuring minor grammatical errors or typos (e.g., "durring" instead of "during"). This reflects a more relaxed approach to writing, typical of online forums
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== THREAD CONTENT ==========
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: My question is primarily towards the developers based in North America who have experience hiring developers overseas.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What issues have you run into? What are the pros and cons?
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: It’s a few things. Timezone differences, lack of direct communication, language barrier, etc.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: A lot can be remedied by strict rules on PRs and good reviewers. Async messaging can be great, and for longer things videos can help. But you really just lack connection inherently to external teams, especially when they’re in countries with vastly different longitudes
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Maybe about India:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * there are many wonderful developers. But if they are good their salary is to much for company looking for cheapest labor overseas. Or they already migrated to e.g. USA
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * there are some interview scams - one person is good on interview, but other person shows up to work
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * there are some really common things when hiring whole teams - 1 or 2 devs from 6 person team actually work and the rest is so weak that they are just a "filler". When you complain you get more "fillers"
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.659Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: * another thing is cultural one - they will agree to literally any schedule etc., regardless if it possible or not. OFC it will not be delivered on time in most cases, so good luck if you base your client estimate on that
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.661Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I am a developer working for a client that is currently stationed in New Jersey and I am in N. Macedonia so I can point out how it is from the other end:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.661Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - The most obvious one is the different timezones. We are 6 hour apart so we have meetings around 9AM EST which is their starting time. Sometimes when we need to discuss something that occured durring the day we'll have a meeting again at 4PM EST. Client is happy with this arrangement and so am I. But I set the expectations in the initial talks that I am only available from 9AM - 11AM and after 4PM EST. Reason for that is that I have a family I want to spend time with between those hours.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.661Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - client mentioned that he had issues previously with a developer which did not have a good understanding of the job he was hired to do. This means that it was a bad hire and/or was cheating the interview process somehow.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.661Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - client also mentioned that few developers had a very thick accent and low vocabulary so that was a big issue as well. Personally, I've been told I have a russian sounding one, but it's still understandable and I have a good vocabulary. Probably from the 4 years I spent living in the US.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.661Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Payment and receipts. We got around this by using upwork as a third party service. I could also have opened a company here and do it that way, but we both agreed for this option for the time being.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.661Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If I think of something else I'll be sure to add it here. I hope this helps

[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issues

[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.663Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:28:46.664Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire).

[2025-05-27T18:29:01.924Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ✅ [OPENAI-PERSONALIZED] Tone analysis complete: Based on the analysis of the Reddit comments provided, here’s a breakdown of the overall tone, common language patterns, typical comment length, grammar style, and how recommendations are given:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.924Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.925Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overall tone of the comments is **candid and pragmatic**. Commenters express a mix of **seriousness and professionalism**, especially when discussing the realities of hiring developers and the challenges of startups. There is also an undercurrent of **frustration** regarding unrealistic expectations from those seeking to hire developers without adequate compensation or understanding of the industry. Some comments have a slightly **humorous or sarcastic** edge, particularly in the empathy exercise, which seeks to highlight the absurdity of expecting developers to work for free or under unrealistic conditions.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.925Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.925Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The language used is mostly **straightforward and professional**, with some technical jargon related to software development (e.g., "MVP," "full stack," "auth"). There are occasional uses of **slang** and informal expressions (e.g., "you get what you pay for," "bleed you dry"), but these are balanced with more formal language when discussing professional experience and recommendations. Abbreviations like "CTO" (Chief Technology Officer) and "FAANG" (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) are also present, indicating familiarity with industry terms.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.925Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 3. Typical Comment Length
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.925Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment lengths vary but tend to be **moderate to long**

[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: So CCO Vibe is a Vibe coding agency and what that means is they build software for people that's like way cheaper and way faster than traditional programmers. So there's like a huge gap in the market right now where a lot of people are coding by hand but these guys use AI to build code really really really fucking fast and so it's a team of some of the best Vibe coders in the world. They're all graduates of Gauntlet AI which is the world's most intense AI boot camp. All graduates have completed 12 weeks for 100 hours a week and they've all built multiple full stacks. They've built products like full messaging apps like Slack clones, TikTok clones, Zendesk clones, customer service clones, a shit ton of amazing products. And now they're opening a Vibe coding agency to help other people get internal tools and their advantage is they can charge way cheaper and way faster and they're American based because they're not coding from hand so they're way more effective and efficient. And yeah, anyway, so this is like MVPs for startups. These are internal tools. Essentially it's just like software for any kind of business. If you're like paying a shit ton of money, you're paying like 100k to Slack a year or something. Just like have these guys build a Slack clone for like 10 or 20k. Yeah, and then there's like no reason to have to pay the subscription fee anymore, you know? So right now they're trying to find a bunch of clients to build products for. That's their biggest bottleneck is like how do we find people that we should code for, you know?

[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Based on the analysis of the Reddit comments provided, here’s a breakdown of the overall tone, common language patterns, typical comment length, grammar style, and how recommendations are given:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 1. Overall Tone
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The overall tone of the comments is **candid and pragmatic**. Commenters express a mix of **seriousness and professionalism**, especially when discussing the realities of hiring developers and the challenges of startups. There is also an undercurrent of **frustration** regarding unrealistic expectations from those seeking to hire developers without adequate compensation or understanding of the industry. Some comments have a slightly **humorous or sarcastic** edge, particularly in the empathy exercise, which seeks to highlight the absurdity of expecting developers to work for free or under unrealistic conditions.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 2. Common Language Patterns
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The language used is mostly **straightforward and professional**, with some technical jargon related to software development (e.g., "MVP," "full stack," "auth"). There are occasional uses of **slang** and informal expressions (e.g., "you get what you pay for," "bleed you dry"), but these are balanced with more formal language when discussing professional experience and recommendations. Abbreviations like "CTO" (Chief Technology Officer) and "FAANG" (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) are also present, indicating familiarity with industry terms.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: ### 3. Typical Comment Length
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment lengths vary but tend to be **moderate to long**

[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Greetings Reddit!
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I have 3 great ideas that I’ve been holding on to for dear life. My mission was to learn to code myself, but then my wife and I began having children and there’s just never enough time. I’m now to the point where I feel like if I don’t start, I never will and I’m not trying to miss out in a world where tech in now crossing leaps and bounds.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Years ago I started on one of the ventures (the biggest one) by finding young coders out of college. I had them all sign NDAs and we’d meet every other weekend. Initially, I approached them with a stake in the company and once they completed, we discuss percentages. I wanted to go this route to continue to motivate them (much like how FB was started). After negotiating, we decided on me paying them for the work, with a discussion about percentages once the job was completed. The problem with that was, there would be 0 progress until we met. Because I was funding it alone, I pretty much canceled everything because I didn’t feel they were taking it seriously. After about 3 months, we only got as far as a sign-in with 2 step verification. I’m not sure if that is standard time for it, but it was buggy and I found myself asking them to fix it often. I swear I’m not a micromanager. I provided the designs for it, and they weren’t coming close on the backend.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Today, I’ve ready to move forward with another idea but I do not want to run into the same issues I did previously which had me shelve the idea for 11 years (which still isn’t close to being done today). Here’s my question… where do I find trusted, professional, developers to help me get this idea into the world? Does such a platform exist?
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Please help! Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.926Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 🔍🔍🔍 [PERSONALIZED-SCORING-PROMPT] ========== EXAMPLE COMMENTS ==========
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 1: It's pretty simple. You need to find a professional. This means that you'll have to pay them well, because good developers charge appropriately. Trying to find students or the cheapest developers on websites like Upwork has a high chance of not ending well (Internet is full of these kind of stories). In other words, you get what you pay for. Problem with shares is that they're worth nothing until the company starts making a reasonable profit. You probably know that most startups fail, and most new companies close within the first year. So, to me at least, shares are not a great way of compensation. The only exception would be if I your devs really believed in the product. But in my experience it's kind of tough to 'sell' the idea and ignite that much passion to a stranger who has no experience in the field. As a dev I spoke to a few people and even though I liked some of the ideas I never liked them that much to be able to sacrifice months of hard work for a mere chance, if things went well.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Lastly, one place / platform where all the 'good' developers gather doesn't exists. All of them are full of all sorts of developers. If you're not looking for free labour, I'm currently looking for a project (I am a professional dev with 10y of experience and a software engineering degree)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 2: Don’t hire developers. Find a technical cofounder or if you can hire a CTO type. Hiring technical talent without being technical yourself is tricky.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: And honestly if you were paying those first guys, sounds like you got ripped off if they only got as far as auth.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Also project management can make or break you. Coordinating talent and budgeting resources is a specialty, again don’t try to do it seriously yourself the first time. Let your cto handle that.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: If you have a budget and market you can focus on that and make sure you and your cto are in sync.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Feel free to dm me if you’d like to chat I do some consulting for first timers and can help you kind of get a lay of the land.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: As to where to hire, it all depends on if you have a budget or not. With a budget you have lots of options.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Comment 3: I’ve been in the software engineering business for quite some time. I do projects for people as well as myself. Here are some issue with trying to protect an idea.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. If I sign your NDA, it could prevent me from taking on a project from another client with a similar idea.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. An NDA represents liability. A 20k project with 100k in liability is a not worth it.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.927Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I always tell people that I will always agree not to reveal YOUR information like sales, strategies, clients etc. But I would never consider restricting what ideas I can implement.

[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Hi!
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: I am a lead engineer with over 15 years of experience. I've owned some large projects at FAANG and other fortunate 500 companies that most people have used. My recommendation is always to work on a collaborative and transparent process but being flexible at the same time. Even with the backing of companies like Amazon, it has never been a strict process. It is always an iterative process as development happens, requirements change, and adaptations happen. I am starting my own shop hoping to provide small business with the same bar and rigor as these huge enterprises I have worked for. Keep in mind, what you are offering is probably why people didn't work until you met. Most junior devs need to focus on learning so you need to accommodate for that time. Of course you can hire professionals like myself who have a lot of experience but you would need to have a professional process and payment. Most professionals won't sign up for working for free without payment until the end because we can easily find work for pay. If you are serious, this is an investment. Every serious business requires investment. Not trying to be harsh but just realistic. If you expect college kids to work for you, the quality of work will be the same as they have to learn a lot initially. If you want real results with a defined process and structure, I would recommend you reevaluate your process. I provide development and consulting services. Happy to have discussions if you want. Feel free to DM me if you'd like.

[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Unless you have serious cash to burn I recommend not hiring developers. Youre not a business yet with cash flow or even something which can generate even just a single dollar.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Its really just an idea you have and nothing more.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: The other thing is that a lot of these comments where people are talking about you hiring them or having a shop of developers you should really just avoid. They will bleed you dry. Think about updating this app, what about iterating on the idea for market fit, what about bug fixes, what about getting their technical buy-in, what about owning the IP of the code?
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: What you need is a technical co-founder. Someone with at least 3-5 years of full stack experience who will buy into your idea and build the prototype without it costing both of you anything beyond 1000 USD.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Every single dollar in the idea phase is precious, dont ever commit to spending until you have real cash flow.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: With the prototype out and maybe 5 - 10 clients who are willing to pay or have paid. You now have a working MVP with proof of cash flow, you can now extrapolate future cash flow, cost curves and so on and build a go to market plan along with a strategy on how to capture the market you believe is capture-able.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: You can now try raise some capital through seed rounds. After getting your initial seed, you will need to both quit your jobs and both of you focus on building the business. This is still an extremely hard phase probably even harder than the prototyping phase
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Evaluate how relevant this Reddit thread is for New CCO Vibe, considering the campaign focus keywords: where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Important: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines and look for indirect signals like:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Expressing frustration or challenges that the business solves
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.930Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Asking if others experience similar issue
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: s
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Describing workarounds they're using
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Sharing related experiences or pain points
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Engaging with topics the business addresses
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Score this thread from 0-100 based on:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How closely the problem matches what New CCO Vibe solves, aligned with the campaign keywords.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How clearly they express a need (directly or indirectly)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - How likely they would be interested in the solution
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Whether they seem to be actively looking for help
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Their apparent frustration/pain level
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Use this scale:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 90-100 = Perfect match (clearly expressing need, actively looking for exactly what we offer, strong alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 70-89 = Strong match (clear problem/need that we solve, good alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 40-69 = Moderate match (showing some signs of problems we address, some alignment with campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 20-39 = Weak match (tangentially related to our solution or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 0-19 = No match (completely unrelated to what we offer or campaign keywords)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Then, if the score is 40 or above:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. Generate three comments as someone who has tried multiple solutions:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Micro (1-2 sentences): super quick casual mention
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Medium (3-4 sentences): casual story with genuine pros/cons:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start with "hey man" or "tbh" or similar
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention free tool with honest pros/cons
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention New CCO Vibe with honest pros/cons (include at least one real downside)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium tool and why it might be overkill
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - Verbose (5-7 sentences): detailed but still casual:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - start super casual like "oh man i feel you on this one"
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe trying free tool - what worked and what didnt
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - describe finding New CCO Vibe - be honest about pros AND cons
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - mention premium option and when it might actually be worth it
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: - end with something helpful like "lmk if you want more details"
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: CRITICAL: You MUST mention THREE different solutions in each comment:
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 1. A FREE tool/solution (be specific and honest about limitations)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. New CCO Vibe (our solution - be honest about pros AND cons)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 3. A PREMIUM/EXPENSIVE tool (be fair about when it's actually worth it)
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Present all three with genuine pros and cons. Include real downsides for our solution too.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Remember: all lowercase, 1-2 spelling mistakes, super casual tone.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: 2. Identify and list 3-5 specific keyword phrases (3-5 words each) from the thread itself that are highly relevant to the business and the campaign's focus keywords (where to find software developer to build internal tools, where to find software developers to hire). These phrases should capture the core problem or specific interest expressed by the Reddit user.
[2025-05-27T18:29:01.931Z] NEXTJS_STDOUT: Return as JSON:
