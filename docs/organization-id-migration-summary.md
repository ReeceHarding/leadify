# Organization ID Migration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive organization ID migration that was implemented to ensure all features in the codebase properly use organization context instead of just user context.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **keyword-performance-collections.ts**: Added `organizationId` field to `KeywordPerformanceDocument` interface
- Created `CreateKeywordPerformanceData` and `UpdateKeywordPerformanceData` interfaces
- Verified all other collections already had organizationId fields

### 2. Actions Updates
- **keywords-actions.ts**: Updated `generateKeywordsAction` to:
  - Accept organizationId parameter
  - Use organizationId when creating keyword performance documents
  - Added auth import and user ID fallback for backward compatibility

### 3. Organization Context Implementation
- **organization-provider.tsx**: Created a context provider that:
  - Manages current organization state
  - Loads user's organizations
  - Persists selection in localStorage
  - Provides organization switching functionality
  
- **organization-selector.tsx**: Created UI component for:
  - Displaying current organization
  - Switching between organizations
  - Creating new organizations

### 4. Frontend Component Updates
Fixed all components to use `currentOrganization` instead of `activeOrganization`:
- **lead-finder-dashboard.tsx**: Updated all organization references and localStorage keys
- **knowledge-base-wrapper.tsx**: Fixed to use currentOrganization
- **voice-settings-wrapper.tsx**: Fixed to use currentOrganization
- **warmup-wrapper.tsx**: Fixed to use currentOrganization
- **my-posts-dashboard.tsx**: Fixed to use currentOrganization
- **organization-settings.tsx**: Fixed to use currentOrganization
- **team-switcher.tsx**: Fixed to use currentOrganization

### 5. Middleware Enhancement
Updated `middleware.ts` to:
- Check for organization context on protected routes
- Redirect to onboarding if no organization exists
- Return 403 error for API routes without organization
- Added route matchers for organization-required paths

### 6. Migration Script
Created `scripts/migrate-organization-ids.ts` that:
- Migrates existing data to add organizationId
- Processes collections in batches of 500
- Uses the user's first (oldest) organization
- Handles all relevant collections:
  - Lead generation (campaigns, generated comments)
  - Warmup (accounts, posts, comments, rate limits)
  - Posting queue (queue, rate limits)
  - Personalization (knowledge base, voice settings, scraped content, Twitter analysis)
  - Keyword performance

## Implementation Details

### Organization Context Pattern
```typescript
// Using organization context in components
const { currentOrganization, isLoading } = useOrganization()

// Persisting organization selection
localStorage.setItem(`currentOrganizationId`, organizationId)

// Campaign selection with organization scope
localStorage.setItem(`campaign_${organizationId}_${userId}`, campaignId)
```

### Reddit Auth Organization Handling
- Organization ID is stored in cookies during Reddit auth flow
- Callback properly retrieves and uses organization context
- Tokens are stored with organization scope

### API Routes Organization Support
All API routes now properly handle organizationId:
- Lead generation APIs use campaign's organizationId
- Queue processing APIs use document's organizationId
- Warmup APIs use account's organizationId

## Verified Components
- Dashboard page checks for organizations and redirects to onboarding
- Onboarding flow creates organizations after profile step
- All Reddit pages use organization context
- Settings pages properly display organization information

## Migration Status
✅ **Completed:**
- All database schema updates
- All action updates
- Organization context provider and UI
- All frontend components
- Middleware organization checks
- Migration script creation

⏳ **Pending:**
- Run migration script on production data
- Add advanced member access controls
- Create organization management documentation
- Comprehensive testing of all features

## Next Steps
1. Run the migration script: `npm run migrate:organization-ids`
2. Test all features with organization switching
3. Monitor for any edge cases
4. Create user documentation for organization management

## Important Notes
- Profile data remains user-specific (not organization-specific)
- Organization selection persists across sessions
- Users without organizations are redirected to onboarding
- All new data automatically includes organizationId
