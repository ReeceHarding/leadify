## Action Items

### High Priority Fixes

1. **Add organizationId to GeneratedCommentDocument**
   - Update the interface in `db/firestore/lead-generation-collections.ts`
   - Update create/update actions to include organizationId
   - Update existing comments via migration

2. **Update Campaign Queries**
   - Ensure all campaign queries use organizationId instead of userId
   - Check dashboard components for proper filtering

3. **Fix Scraped Content**
   - Ensure scraped content uses organizationId consistently
   - Update any queries that might use userId

### Medium Priority Fixes

1. **Update Error Messages**
   - Make error messages more specific about organization context
   - Add better logging for organization-related operations

2. **Add Validation**
   - Add organizationId validation to all create/update operations
   - Use the organization-utils validation functions consistently

3. **Update Components**
   - Ensure all components check for active organization
   - Show proper error states when no organization is selected

### Low Priority Improvements

1. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove commented out legacy code
   - Update documentation to reflect organization-based architecture
   - Add more comprehensive logging

2. **Performance**
   - Review and optimize organization-based queries
   - Consider caching organization data in components

## Files That Need Updates

### Must Update
1. `db/firestore/lead-generation-collections.ts` - Add organizationId to GeneratedCommentDocument
2. `actions/db/lead-generation-actions.ts` - Include organizationId in comment creation
3. `actions/integrations/openai/openai-actions.ts` - Pass organizationId when creating comments

### Should Review
1. All dashboard components - Ensure proper organization filtering
2. All API routes - Validate organization context
3. All server actions - Add organization validation

### Nice to Have
1. Better organization switching UI
2. Organization-specific settings pages
3. Multi-organization support improvements

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new organization
- [ ] Switch between organizations
- [ ] Create campaign with organization
- [ ] Generate leads with proper organizationId
- [ ] Post comments with organization context
- [ ] Knowledge base per organization
- [ ] Voice settings per organization
- [ ] Warmup accounts per organization
- [ ] Reddit auth per organization

## Conclusion

The codebase has been largely migrated to use organization IDs, but there are still some critical gaps:
1. GeneratedCommentDocument lacks organizationId field
2. Some queries might still filter by userId instead of organizationId
3. Error handling and validation could be more consistent

The migration script exists and handles most of the data migration, but we need to ensure all new data is created with proper organization context.
