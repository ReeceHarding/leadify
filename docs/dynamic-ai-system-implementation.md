# Dynamic AI Reasoning System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully replaced hard-coded, client-specific AI prompts with a dynamic, adaptive system that works for any client, industry, or use case. The system provides frameworks for thinking rather than rigid templates.

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before (Hard-coded Problems)
- ❌ Fixed persona: "AI bootcamp graduate", "cco vibe" 
- ❌ Hard-coded business context that only worked for one client
- ❌ No integration with existing comment context
- ❌ Template rigidity that couldn't adapt to different industries
- ❌ Simple scoring without sophisticated lead qualification

### After (Dynamic Solution)
- ✅ **Fully Variable System**: All context dynamically injected
- ✅ **Industry Agnostic**: Works for hotels, restaurants, SaaS, consulting, etc.
- ✅ **Comment Integration**: Natural references to existing conversation
- ✅ **Authentic Writing Style**: Copies exact human patterns verbatim
- ✅ **Sophisticated Scoring**: Twitter-style lead qualification approach

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: Teach How to Think, Not What to Say

The AI receives frameworks and context variables, then reasons through each unique situation rather than following rigid scripts.

## 📊 Dynamic Scoring System

### New Scoring Prompt Structure
```typescript
const scoringPrompt = `You are a lead qualification expert. Evaluate how likely the person behind this Reddit post is a potential customer.

POST ANALYSIS:
Title: "${threadTitle}"
Content: "${threadContent}"
Author: u/${threadAuthor}
Subreddit: r/${subreddit}
Posted: ${timeReference}

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Search Keywords: "${campaignKeywords.join(', ')}"
Our Business: ${businessDescription}
Organization: ${organizationName}
${websiteContent ? `Additional Context: ${websiteContent}` : ''}

IMPORTANT: People rarely directly ask for solutions. Read between the lines for indirect signals:
- Expressing frustration or challenges
- Asking if others experience similar issues
- Describing workarounds they're using
- Sharing related experiences or pain points
- Engaging with related topics or discussions

Score from 0-100 based on:
- How closely they match someone who would benefit from our solution
- How clearly they express a problem related to our business (directly or indirectly)
- How likely they would be interested in our offering
- Whether they seem actively looking for solutions
- Their apparent frustration/pain level with current situation

Scale:
90-100 = Perfect lead (clearly expressing need, actively seeking solutions)
70-89 = Strong lead (clear problem/need expression)
40-69 = Moderate potential (showing some signs of the problem)
10-39 = Weak signal (tangentially related)
0-9 = Not a potential customer`
```

## ✍️ Dynamic Comment Generation System

### Template Variables System
```typescript
interface CommentTemplateVariables {
  // Business Context
  organizationName: string
  businessDescription: string
  websiteContent?: string
  voiceSettings?: string
  
  // Post Context
  threadTitle: string
  threadContent: string
  threadAuthor: string
  subreddit: string
  timeReference: string
  existingComments: string[]
  
  // Style Context
  enthusiasmLevel: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  industryTerminology: string[]
  commonPainPoints: string[]
  
  // Solution Context
  solutionName: string
  alternativeOptions: string[]
  pricingModel?: string
  uniqueValueProp: string
}
```

### Writing Style Framework (Copies Human Patterns Exactly)
```typescript
const commentGenerationPrompt = `You are a genuine Reddit user who loves helping others.

WRITING STYLE RULES (FOLLOW EXACTLY):
- Copy this enthusiasm style: "This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!"
- Use exclamation points naturally like the template
- Keep casual, imperfect capitalization
- Break into paragraphs exactly like template structure
- NEVER use hyphens anywhere (write "3rd party" not "third-party")
- Use "$" instead of "money", "cost", "budget"
- Natural conversation flow with authentic energy

YOUR BACKGROUND:
${businessDescription}
Organization: ${organizationName}
${websiteContent ? `Additional Context: ${websiteContent}` : ''}
${voiceSettings ? `Communication Style: ${voiceSettings}` : ''}

COMMENT GENERATION STRATEGY:
${existingComments?.length > 0 ? 
`1. Reference existing comments naturally: "I've seen a few people mention X. I agree with that to an extent, but..." or "Building on what others said..."` : 
`1. Start with genuine enthusiasm for their challenge`}

2. Follow EXACT template structure (copy this format exactly):
   - Enthusiastic opener: "I would love to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!"
   - Present key questions: "There are a handful of things you need to consider: [relevant questions for their situation]?"
   - Give 3 genuine options with honest pros/cons
   - Include ${organizationName} as ONE natural option among others
   - Close enthusiastically: "Again, I'd love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!"

3. Adapt the three options to their specific industry/situation:
   - Option A: [Most common/cheaper approach in their field]
   - Option B: [Middle ground approach]
   - Option C: [Professional/premium approach - naturally mention ${organizationName} here]

CRITICAL: Never use hyphens anywhere. Write naturally with enthusiasm but don't sound robotic.`
```

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. **Comment Context Integration**
- Naturally references existing comments: "I've seen a few people mention X. I agree with that to an extent, but..."
- Builds on conversation rather than ignoring it
- Adapts tone based on existing discussion

### 2. **Authentic Writing Style Replication**
- Copies exact human writing patterns including:
  - Specific exclamation point usage
  - Natural capitalization imperfections
  - Paragraph structure patterns
  - Casual abbreviations ("$" instead of "money")
  - No hyphens anywhere (per human template)

### 3. **Industry Adaptability**
- Same structure works for any business:
  - Software consulting → "Option C: Hire a development company like [OrganizationName]"
  - Restaurant marketing → "Option C: Work with a marketing agency like [OrganizationName]"
  - Hotel management → "Option C: Partner with a hospitality consultant like [OrganizationName]"

### 4. **Three-Option Framework**
Every response follows the proven structure:
- **Option A**: Most common/budget approach
- **Option B**: Middle ground solution
- **Option C**: Professional/premium approach (includes client's solution naturally)

### 5. **Dynamic Question Generation**
Questions adapt to industry and context:
- Tech: "What's your technical background? How much $ do you want to invest?"
- Marketing: "What's your brand positioning? What's your timeline?"
- Operations: "How complex are your processes? What's your risk tolerance?"

## 📋 Implementation Files Changed

### Core Logic
- `actions/integrations/openai/openai-actions.ts` - Complete rewrite of scoring and generation

### Supporting Files
- All existing data structures support the new variables
- Existing database schemas work with dynamic content
- Frontend remains unchanged (displays dynamic content seamlessly)

## 🎯 Results

### For Scoring
- **Before**: Simple relevance check
- **After**: Sophisticated lead qualification that reads between the lines

### For Comments  
- **Before**: Generic, robot-like responses
- **After**: Authentic, contextual, industry-specific help that sounds genuinely human

### For Adaptability
- **Before**: Only worked for "cco vibe" AI consulting
- **After**: Works for any business with proper context variables

## 🚀 Usage Example

For a hotel asking about booking software:

**Variables Input**:
```typescript
{
  organizationName: "HotelTech Solutions",
  businessDescription: "We build custom booking and management systems for hotels",
  threadTitle: "Need better booking system for our boutique hotel",
  threadContent: "Our current system is slow and guests complain...",
  existingComments: ["Try booking.com", "Look into PMS systems"],
  // ... other context
}
```

**Generated Response**:
```
I would love to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!

I've seen a few people mention PMS systems and booking.com. I agree with that to an extent, but there are some important things to consider first: how many rooms do you manage? How much $ do you want to invest? What's your tolerance for risk? And where is your technical expertise? Then you have a few options.

A: Use existing platforms like Booking.com or Expedia:
[Detailed pros/cons for hotel industry]

B: Implement an off the shelf PMS system:  
[Detailed pros/cons for hotel industry]

C: Build a custom solution:
Interview some companies and choose one you feel understands YOUR needs, and can explain their expertise in a way that makes sense to you. Look at companies like HotelTech Solutions, or other hospitality software firms and ask to set up an intro call...

Again, I'd love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!
```
