# Legacy Code Cleanup Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the complete cleanup of remaining legacy code that still uses profile-based or user-based approaches instead of the new organization-based structure.

## Current Status

✅ Organization data models implemented
✅ Organization-based Reddit authentication implemented  
✅ Migration script created
✅ Organization provider implemented
✅ UI components converted to organization-based approach
✅ Core app pages updated to use organization-based logic
✅ Unused profile imports removed from OpenAI actions
✅ TypeScript errors fixed and legacy profile fields removed

## Phase 1: Update UI Components (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 1.1 Lead Finder Dashboard

**File:** `app/reddit/lead-finder/_components/lead-finder-dashboard.tsx`
**Issue:** Line 327 calls `getProfileByUserIdAction(user.id)`

**Fix:** Remove profile dependency, use organization-based knowledge base only

### 1.3 Campaign Selector

**File:** `app/reddit/lead-finder/_components/campaign-selector.tsx`
**Issue:** Imports and may use `getProfileByUserIdAction`
**Fix:** Remove profile imports, use organization context

### 1.4 Find New Leads Dialog

**File:** `app/reddit/lead-finder/_components/find-new-leads-dialog.tsx`
**Issue:** Lines 78, 120 call `getProfileByUserIdAction(userId)`
**Fix:** Use organization context instead

### 1.5 Customize Keywords Dialog

**File:** `app/reddit/lead-finder/_components/dashboard/customize-keywords-dialog.tsx`

### 1.6 Find More Leads Component

**File:** `app/reddit/lead-finder/_components/dashboard/find-more-leads.tsx`
**Issue:** Line 254 calls `getProfileByUserIdAction(userId)`
**Fix:** Use organization context

### 1.7 My Posts Dashboard

**File:** `app/reddit/my-posts/_components/my-posts-dashboard.tsx`
**Issue:** Imports `getProfileByUserIdAction`
**Fix:** Remove profile dependency

### 1.8 Debug Components

**File:** `app/debug/lead-generation-debug/_components/lead-generation-debugger.tsx`
**Issue:** Lines 113, 208, 297 call `getProfileByUserIdAction(user.id)`
**Fix:** Use organization context for debugging

## Phase 2: Update Server Actions (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### 2.1 Remove Legacy User-Based Functions

**Files:**

- `actions/db/personalization-actions.ts`
- `actions/db/campaign-actions.ts`
- `actions/db/lead-generation-actions.ts`
- `actions/db/warmup-actions.ts`
- `actions/db/posting-history-actions.ts`

**Action:** Mark as deprecated and remove after confirming no usage

### 2.2 Update OpenAI Actions

**File:** `actions/integrations/openai/openai-actions.ts`
**Issue:** Still imports legacy user-based functions
**Fix:** Update to use organization-based functions

## Phase 3: Update Core App Pages (LOW PRIORITY)

### 3.1 Dashboard Page

**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Issue:** Uses profile for onboarding check
**Fix:** Use organization membership for onboarding check

### 3.2 Onboarding Page

**File:** `app/onboarding/page.tsx`

**Issue:** Loads profile for onboarding check
**Fix:** Use organization-based onboarding check

## Phase 4: Data Model Cleanup

### 4.1 Remove Legacy Profile Fields

**Remove:**

- `website?: string`
- `keywords?: string[]`
- `redditAccessToken?: string`
- `redditRefreshToken?: string`
- `redditTokenExpiresAt?: Timestamp`
- `redditUsername?: string`
- `businessDescription?: string`

### 4.2 Update Profile Types

**File:** `types/profile-types.ts`
**Action:** Remove legacy fields from SerializedProfileDocument

### 4.3 Clean Campaign Document

**File:** `db/firestore/lead-generation-collections.ts`
**Remove:**

- `website: string` (now in organization)
- `businessDescription?: string` (now in organization)

## Phase 5: Remove Deprecated Actions

### 5.1 Profile-Based Reddit Actions

**Files:** `actions/integrations/reddit/reddit-oauth-actions.ts`
**Remove:**

- `saveRedditTokensToProfileAction`
- `getRedditTokensFromProfileAction`
- `refreshRedditTokenFromProfileAction`
- `clearRedditTokensFromProfileAction`

### 5.2 User-Based Legacy Actions

**Remove all functions marked as "Legacy" in:**

- `actions/db/personalization-actions.ts`
- `actions/db/campaign-actions.ts`
- `actions/db/lead-generation-actions.ts`
- `actions/db/warmup-actions.ts`
- `actions/db/posting-history-actions.ts`

## Implementation Order

### Week 1: UI Components

1. Update lead finder dashboard
2. Update knowledge base wrapper
3. Update campaign selector
4. Update dialogs and forms

### Week 2: Server Actions

1. Remove legacy user-based functions
2. Update OpenAI actions
3. Test all workflows

### Week 3: Core Pages

1. Update dashboard page
2. Update onboarding flow
3. Update layout

### Week 4: Cleanup

1. Remove legacy profile fields
2. Remove deprecated actions
3. Update types
4. Run migration script
5. Full system test

## Success Criteria

✅ No components use `getProfileByUserIdAction`
✅ No actions use user-based queries for organization data
✅ All Reddit authentication uses organization tokens
✅ All lead generation uses organization context
✅ Profile document only contains user identity data
✅ No duplicate business data between entities
✅ All tests pass
✅ No increase in error rates

## Rollback Plan

1. Keep backup of all collections before changes

5. Ability to revert to profile-based approach if needed

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for all updated actions
2. Integration tests for organization workflows
3. E2E tests for lead generation flow
4. Performance testing for organization queries
5. User acceptance testing for UI changes

## Post-Cleanup Tasks

1. Update documentation
2. Update API documentation
3. Clean up unused imports
4. Optimize organization queries
5. Add monitoring for organization-based metrics
