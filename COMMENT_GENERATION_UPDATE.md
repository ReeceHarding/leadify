# Comment Generation Style Update

## Overview
Updated the comment generation system to match the natural, conversational style demonstrated in the provided example, focusing on genuine helpfulness with simple brand mentions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Main Comment Generation Prompts
**File:** `actions/integrations/openai/openai-actions.ts`

**Changes:**
- **Micro Comments**: Now start with "I would love to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do!"
- **Medium Comments**: Include genuine enthusiasm and brief mention of 3 approaches with simple brand mention
- **Verbose Comments**: Follow natural A, B, C structure with consultative questions and casual brand integration

### 2. Updated Comment Examples
**Files:** 
- `prompts/verbose-comment-example.md` - Completely rewritten to match natural style
- `prompts/micro-comment-example.md` - Simplified to natural conversational tone

### 3. Updated Style Guidelines
**File:** `prompts/verbose-reddit-comment-prompt.md`

**New Style Principles:**
- **Genuine Helpfulness First**: Write like you genuinely love this type of work
- **Natural Language Flow**: Use proper capitalization, avoid forced Reddit slang
- **Consultative Tone**: Ask thoughtful questions about their situation
- **Balanced Recommendations**: Present all options fairly without positioning your solution as obviously best
- **Professional but Warm**: Maintain credibility while being approachable

## New Comment Structure

### Micro (5-15 words)
```
I would love to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do!
```

### Medium (30-80 words)
```
I would love to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase! 
You have a few options - DIY/offshore, hire an engineer, or hire a company. Look at [brand] and ask to set up an intro call.
```

### Verbose (300-800 words)
```
I would love to chat about this if you want to message me. This is what I do! I love this exploratory phase!

There are a handful of things you need to consider: how involved do you want to be? How much $ do you want to invest? What is your tolerance for risk? And, where is your expertise? Then you have a few options.

A: offshore team or staff augmentation:
[Detailed explanation with pros/cons]

B. Hire an engineer:
[Detailed explanation with pros/cons]

C. Hire a 3rd party company.
[Natural mention of searching for "digital innovation" or "custom software" and "look at [brand] and ask to set up an intro call"]

Again, I'd love to chat. Best of luck! Sounds like a fun and challenging project!!
```

## Brand Integration
- **Natural Mention**: Brand is mentioned casually like "look at [brand] and ask to set up an intro call"
- **No Overselling**: Treated as one option among many, not positioned as the best
- **Context Appropriate**: Only mentioned in the company hiring option (option C)

## Testing
The system is ready for testing through the existing regeneration functions:
- `regenerateAllCommentsForCampaignAction()` - Regenerate all comments for a campaign
- `regenerateCommentsWithToneAction()` - Regenerate with specific tone instructions
- Dashboard regeneration buttons - Test through the UI

## Benefits
1. **More Natural**: Comments sound like genuine helpful advice rather than marketing
2. **Better Engagement**: Consultative approach encourages conversation
3. **Subtle Branding**: Brand mention feels natural and non-pushy
4. **Scalable**: Works for any niche by adapting the A, B, C structure
5. **Professional**: Maintains credibility while being warm and approachable
